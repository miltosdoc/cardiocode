New recommendations (1)
Recommendations
Class Level
Diagnosis of coronary artery disease
Omission of invasive coronary angiography should be considered in TAVI candidates, if 
procedural planning CCTA is of sufficient quality to rule out significant CAD.
IIa
B
PCI should be considered in patients with a primary indication to undergo TAVI and ≥90% 
coronary artery stenosis in segments with a reference diameter ≥2.5 mm.
IIa
B
Indications for intervention in severe aortic regurgitation 
TAVI may be considered for the treatment of severe AR in symptomatic patients ineligible for 
surgery according to the Heart Team, if the anatomy is suitable.
IIb
B
Indications for intervention in symptomatic and asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis, and recommended 
mode of intervention 
Intervention should be considered in asymptomatic patients (confirmed by a normal exercise 
test, if feasible) with severe, high-gradient AS and LVEF ≥50%, as an alternative to close active 
surveillance, if the procedural risk is low.
IIa
A
TAVI may be considered for the treatment of severe BAV stenosis in patients at increased 
surgical risk, if the anatomy is suitable.

New recommendations (2)
Recommendations
Class Level
Indications for intervention in severe primary mitral regurgitation 
Surgical MV repair is recommended in low-risk asymptomatic patients with severe PMR 
without LV dysfunction (LVESD <40 mm, LVESDi <20 mm/m2, and LVEF >60%) when a durable 
result is likely, if at least three of the following criteria are fulfilled: 
•AF
•SPAP at rest >50 mmHg
•LA dilatation (LAVI ≥60 mL/m2 or LA diameter ≥55 mm)
•Concomitant secondary TR ≥ moderate.
I
B
Minimally invasive MV surgery may be considered at experienced centres to reduce the length 
of stay and accelerate recovery.
IIb
B
Indications for intervention in secondary mitral regurgitation 
MV surgery, surgical AF ablation, if indicated, and LAAO should be considered in symptomatic 
patients with severe atrial SMR under optimal medical therapy. 
IIa
B
TEER may be considered in symptomatic patients with severe atrial SMR not eligible for surgery 
after optimization of medical therapy including rhythm control, when appropriate.
IIb
B
MV surgery may be considered in patients with moderate SMR undergoing CABG.

New recommendations (3)
Recommendations
Class Level
Indications for mitral valve surgery and transcatheter intervention in clinically severe rheumatic and 
degenerative mitral stenosis 
TMVI may be considered in symptomatic patients with extensive MAC and severe MV 
dysfunction at experienced Heart Valve Centres with expertise in complex MV surgery and 
transcatheter interventions.
IIb
C
Indications for intervention in tricuspid regurgitation 
Careful evaluation of TR aetiology, stage of the disease (i.e. degree of TR severity, RV and LV 
dysfunction, and PH), patient operative risk, and likelihood of recovery by a multidisciplinary 
Heart Team is recommended in patients with severe TR prior to intervention.
I
C
Surgery of concomitant severe mitral regurgitation 
MV surgery is recommended in patients with severe MR undergoing surgery for another valve.

New recommendations (4)
Recommendations
Class Level
Indications for intervention in patients with mixed moderate aortic stenosis and moderate aortic 
regurgitation 
Intervention is recommended in symptomatic patients with mixed moderate AV stenosis and 
moderate regurgitation, and a mean gradient ≥40 mmHg or Vmax ≥4.0 m/s.
I
B
Intervention is recommended in asymptomatic patients with mixed moderate AV stenosis and 
moderate regurgitation, with Vmax ≥4.0 m/s and LVEF <50% not attributable to other cardiac 
disease.

C
Prosthetic valve selection
An MHV should be considered in patients with an estimated long life expectancy, if there are 
no contraindications for long-term OAC.
IIa
B
Management of antithrombotic therapy in patients with a mechanical heart valve 
It is recommended that INR targets are based on the type and position of MHV, patient’s risk 
factors, and comorbidities.
I
A
Patient education is recommended to improve the quality of OAC.

New recommendations (5)
Recommendations
Class Level
Management of antithrombotic therapy in patients with mechanical heart valves undergoing elective non-
cardiac surgery or invasive procedures 
Continuing VKA treatment is recommended in patients with an MHV for minor or minimally 
invasive interventions associated with no or minimal bleeding.
I
A
Interruption (3–4 days before surgery), and resumption of VKA without bridging, may be 
considered to reduce bleeding in patients with new-generation aortic MHV and no other 
thrombo-embolic risk factors undergoing major non-cardiac surgery or invasive procedures.
