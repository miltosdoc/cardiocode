Guidelines and\ntheir recommendations should facilitate decision making of health pro-\nfessionals in their daily practice. However, the final decisions concerning\nan individual patient must be made by the responsible health professio-\nnal(s) in consultation with the patient and caregiver as appropriate.\nA great number of guidelines have been issued in recent years by\nthe European Society of Cardiology (ESC), as well as by other\nsocieties and organizations. Because of their impact on clinical prac-\ntice, quality criteria for the development of guidelines have been\nestablished in order to make all decisions transparent to the user.\nThe recommendations for formulating and issuing ESC Guidelines\ncan be found on the ESC website (https://www.escardio.org/\nGuidelines). The ESC Guidelines represent the official position of the\nESC on a given topic and are regularly updated.\nIn addition to the publication of Clinical Practice guidelines, the ESC\ncarries out the EURObservational Research Programme of international\nregistries of cardiovascular (CV) diseases and interventions which are\nessential to assess diagnostic/therapeutic processes, use of resources\nand adherence to guidelines. These registries aim at providing a better\nunderstanding of medical practice in Europe and around the world,\nbased on high-quality data collected during routine clinical practice.\nFurthermore, the ESC has developed and embedded in this document\na set of quality indicators (QIs), which are tools to evaluate the level of\nimplementation of the guidelines and may be used by the ESC, hospitals,\nhealthcare providers and professionals to measure clinical practice as\nwell as used in educational programmes, alongside the key messages\nfrom the guidelines, to improve quality of care and clinical outcomes.\nThe Members of this Task Force were selected by the ESC, includ-\ning representation from its relevant ESC sub-specialty groups, in\norder to represent professionals involved with the medical care of\npatients with this pathology. Selected experts in the field undertook a\ncomprehensive review of the published evidence for management of\na given condition according to ESC Clinical Practice Guidelines\n(CPG) Committee policy. A critical evaluation of diagnostic and ther-\napeutic procedures was performed, including assessment of the\nrisk\u0002benefit ratio. The level of evidence and the strength of the rec-\nommendation of particular management options were weighed and\ngraded according to predefined scales, as outlined below.\nThe experts of the writing and reviewing panels provided declara-\ntion of interest forms for all relationships that might be perceived as\nreal or potential sources of conflicts of interest. Their declarations of\ninterest were reviewed according to the ESC declaration of interest\nrules and can be found on the ESC website (http://www.escardio.org/\nguidelines) and have been compiled in a report and published in a\nsupplementary document simultaneously to the guidelines.\nThis process ensures transparency and prevents potential biases in\nthe development and review processes. Any changes in declarations of\ninterest that arise during the writing period were notified to the ESC\nand updated. The Task Force received its entire financial support from\nthe ESC without any involvement from the healthcare industry.\nThe ESC CPG supervises and coordinates the preparation of new\nguidelines. The Committee is also responsible for the endorsement\nprocess of these Guidelines. The ESC Guidelines undergo extensive\nreview by the CPG and external experts. After appropriate revisions\nthe guidelines are signed-off by all the experts involved in the Task\nForce. The finalized document is signed-off by the CPG for publica-\ntion in the European Heart Journal. The guidelines were developed\nafter careful consideration of the scientific and medical knowledge\nand the evidence available at the time of their dating.\nThe task of developing ESC Guidelines also includes the creation of\neducational tools and implementation programmes for the recommen-\ndations including condensed pocket guideline versions, summary slides,\nsummary cards for non-specialists and an electronic version for digital\napplications (smartphones, etc.). These versions are abridged and thus,\nESC Guidelines\n3607\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/36/3599/6358045 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n..............................\nfor more detailed information, the user should always access to the full\ntext version of the guidelines, which is freely available via the ESC web-\nsite and hosted on the European Heart Journal website. The National\nCardiac Societies of the ESC are encouraged to endorse, adopt, trans-\nlate and implement all ESC Guidelines. Implementation programmes\nare needed because it has been shown that the outcome of disease\nmay be favourably influenced by the thorough application of clinical\nrecommendations.\nHealth\nprofessionals\nare\nencouraged\nto\ntake\nthe\nESC\nGuidelines fully into account when exercising their clinical\njudgment, as well as in the determination and the implementation\nof preventive, diagnostic, or therapeutic medical strategies.\nHowever, the ESC Guidelines do not override in any way whatso-\never the individual responsibility of health professionals to make\nappropriate and accurate decisions in consideration of each\npatient’s health condition and in consultation with that patient or\nthe patient’s caregiver where appropriate and/or necessary. It is\nalso the health professional’s responsibility to verify the rules and\nregulations applicable in each country to drugs and devices at the\ntime of prescription.\nTable 2\nLevels of evidence\n©ESC 2021\nLevel of \nevidence A\nData derived from multiple randomized clinical trials \nor meta-analyses. \nLevel of \nevidence B\nData derived from a single randomized clinical trial\nor large non-randomized studies. \nLevel of \nevidence C\nConsensus of opinion of the experts and/or small studies, \nretrospective studies, registries.\nTable 1\nClasses of recommendations\n©ESC 2021\nClasses of recommendations\nClass I \nEvidence and/or general agreement\nthat a given treatment or procedure is\nbeneficial, useful, effective. \nConflicting evidence and/or a divergence of opinion about the usefulness/ \nefficacy of the given treatment or procedure. \nIs recommended or is indicated\nWording to use\nDefinition\nClass III \nEvidence or general agreement that the\ngiven treatment or procedure is not\nuseful/effective, and in some cases\nmay be harmful. \nIs not recommended\n     Class IIb\nUsefulness/efficacy is less well\nestablished by evidence/opinion.\nMay be considered\n \n   Class IIa\nWeight of evidence/opinion is in\nfavour of usefulness/efficacy. \nShould be considered\nClass II \n3608\nESC Guidelines\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/36/3599/6358045 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n2 Introduction\nThe aim of this ESC Guideline is to help health professionals manage\npeople with heart failure (HF) according to the best available evi-\ndence. Fortunately, we now have a wealth of clinical trials to help us\nselect the best management to improve the outcomes for people\nwith HF; for many, it is now both preventable and treatable. This\nguideline provides practical, evidence-based recommendations.\nWe have revised the format of the previous 2016 ESC HF\nGuidelines1 to make each phenotype of HF stand-alone in terms of\nits diagnosis and management. The therapy recommendations men-\ntion the treatment effect supported by the class and level of evidence\nand are presented in tables. For HF with reduced ejection fraction\n(HFrEF), the tabular recommendations focus on mortality and mor-\nbidity outcomes. Where there are symptomatic benefits, these are\nhighlighted in the text and/or in the web appendices. Detailed sum-\nmaries of the trials underpinning the recommendations are available\nin the web appendices. For diagnostic indications, we have suggested\ninvestigations that all patients with HF should receive, and investiga-\ntions that can be targeted to specific circumstances. As diagnostic\ntests have rarely been subject to randomized controlled trials\n(RCTs), most of the evidence would be regarded as level C.\nHowever, that does not mean that there has not been appropriate\nrigorous evaluation of diagnostic tests.\nIn this guideline, we have decided to focus on the diagnosis and\ntreatment of HF, not on its prevention. Management of CV risk and\nmany CV diseases [especially systemic hypertension, diabetes melli-\ntus, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction (MI), atrial fibrilla-\ntion (AF), and asymptomatic left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction]\nwill reduce the risk of developing HF, which is addressed by many\nother ESC Guidelines and in section 9.1 of the current guideline.2\u00027\nThis guideline is the result of a collaboration between the Task\nForce (including two patient representatives), the reviewers, and the\nESC CPG Committee. As such, it is a consensus/majority opinion of\nthe experts consulted in its development.\n2.1 What is new\nIn addition to the recommendations listed below, the following table\nlists some new concepts compared with the 2016 version.\nNew concepts\nA change of the term ‘heart failure with mid-range ejection fraction’ to\n‘heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction’ (HFmrEF).\nA new simpliﬁed treatment algorithm for HFrEF.\nThe addition of a treatment algorithm for HFrEF according to\nphenotypes.\nModiﬁed classiﬁcation for acute HF.\nUpdated treatments for most non-cardiovascular comorbidities\nincluding diabetes, hyperkalaemia, iron deﬁciency, and cancer.\nUpdates on cardiomyopathies including the role of genetic testing and\nnew treatments.\nThe addition of key quality indicators.\nHF = heart failure.\nNew recommendations\nRecommendations\nClass\nRecommendations for the diagnosis of HF\nRight heart catheterization should be considered in patients\nwhere HF is thought to be due to constrictive pericarditis,\nrestrictive cardiomyopathy, congenital heart disease, and high\noutput states.\nIIa\nRight heart catheterization may be considered in selected\npatients with HFpEF to conﬁrm the diagnosis.\nIIb\nRecommendations for treatment of chronic HF\nHFrEF\nDapagliﬂozin or empagliﬂozin are recommended for patients\nwith HFrEF to reduce the risk of HF hospitalization and\ndeath.\nI\nVericiguat may be considered in patients in NYHA class II\u0002IV\nwho have had worsening HF despite treatment with an ACE-I\n(or ARNI), a beta-blocker and an MRA to reduce the risk of\nCV mortality or HF hospitalization.\nIIb\nHFmrEF\nAn ACE-I may be considered for patients with HFmrEF to\nreduce the risk of HF hospitalization and death.\nIIb\nAn ARB may be considered for patients with HFmrEF to\nreduce the risk of HF hospitalization and death.\nIIb\nA beta-blocker may be considered for patients with HFmrEF\nto reduce the risk of HF hospitalization and death.\nIIb\nAn MRA may be considered for patients with HFmrEF to\nreduce the risk of HF hospitalization and death.\nIIb\nSacubitril/valsartan may be considered for patients with\nHFmrEF to reduce the risk of HF hospitalization and death.\nIIb\nHFpEF\nScreening for, and treatment of, aetiologies, and CV and non-\nCV comorbidities are recommended in patients with HFpEF\n(see relevant sections of this document).\nI\nPrevention and monitoring\nSelf-management strategies are recommended to reduce the\nrisk of HF hospitalization and mortality.\nI\nEither home-based and/or clinic-based programmes improve\noutcomes and are recommended to reduce the risk of HF\nhospitalization and mortality.\nI\nInﬂuenza and pneumococcal vaccinations should be consid-\nered in order to prevent HF hospitalizations.\nIIa\nA supervised, exercise-based, cardiac rehabilitation pro-\ngramme should be considered in patients with more severe\ndisease, frailty, or with comorbidities.\nIIa\nNon-invasive HTM may be considered for patients with HF in\norder to reduce the risk of recurrent CV and HF hospitaliza-\ntions and CV death.\nIIb\nRecommendations for management of patients with advanced\nHF\nPatients being considered for long-term MCS must have good\ncompliance, appropriate capacity for device handling and psy-\nchosocial support.\nI\nContinued\nESC 2021\n............................................................................................................................................................................\nESC Guidelines\n3609\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/36/3599/6358045 by guest on 14 January 2026",

Fortunately, we now have a wealth of clinical trials to help us\nselect the best management to improve the outcomes for people\nwith HF; for many, it is now both preventable and treatable. This\nguideline provides practical, evidence-based recommendations.\nWe have revised the format of the previous 2016 ESC HF\nGuidelines1 to make each phenotype of HF stand-alone in terms of\nits diagnosis and management. The therapy recommendations men-\ntion the treatment effect supported by the class and level of evidence\nand are presented in tables. For HF with reduced ejection fraction\n(HFrEF), the tabular recommendations focus on mortality and mor-\nbidity outcomes. Where there are symptomatic benefits, these are\nhighlighted in the text and/or in the web appendices. Detailed sum-\nmaries of the trials underpinning the recommendations are available\nin the web appendices. For diagnostic indications, we have suggested\ninvestigations that all patients with HF should receive, and investiga-\ntions that can be targeted to specific circumstances. As diagnostic\ntests have rarely been subject to randomized controlled trials\n(RCTs), most of the evidence would be regarded as level C.\nHowever, that does not mean that there has not been appropriate\nrigorous evaluation of diagnostic tests.\nIn this guideline, we have decided to focus on the diagnosis and\ntreatment of HF, not on its prevention.

TSAT.\nI\nIntravenous iron supplementation with ferric carboxymaltose\nshould be considered in symptomatic HF patients recently hospi-\ntalized for HF and with LVEF <_50% and iron deﬁciency, deﬁned\nas serum ferritin <100 ng/mL or serum ferritin 100\u0002299 ng/mL\nwith TSAT <20%, to reduce the risk of HF hospitalization.\nIIa\nTreatment of anaemia in HF with erythropoietin

It is due to a structural and/or functional abnormality of the\nheart that results in elevated intracardiac pressures and/or inad-\nequate cardiac output at rest and/or during exercise.\nIdentification of the aetiology of the underlying cardiac dysfunction\nis mandatory in the diagnosis of HF as the specific pathology can\ndetermine subsequent treatment. Most commonly, HF is due to\nmyocardial dysfunction: either systolic, diastolic, or both. However,\npathology of the valves, pericardium, and endocardium, and abnor-\nmalities of heart rhythm and conduction can also cause or contribute\nto HF.\n3.2 Terminology\n3.2.1 Heart failure with preserved, mildly reduced, and\nreduced ejection fraction\nTraditionally, HF has been divided into distinct phenotypes based on\nthe measurement of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)\n(Table 3). The rationale behind this relates to the original treatment\ntrials in HF that demonstrated substantially improved outcomes in\npatients with LVEF <_40%. However, HF spans the entire range of\nLVEF (a normally distributed variable), and measurement by echocar-\ndiography is subject to substantial variability. We have decided on the\nfollowing classification of HF (Table 3):\n• Reduced LVEF is defined as <_40%, i.e. those with a significant\nreduction in LV systolic function. This is designated as HFrEF.\n• Patients with a LVEF between 41% and 49% have mildly reduced\nLV systolic function, i.e. HFmrEF. Retrospective analyses from\nRCTs in HFrEF or HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)\nthat have included patients with ejection fractions in the\n40\u000250% range suggest that they may benefit from similar\nRecommendations for management of patients with HF and AF\nDOACs are recommended in preference to VKAs in\npatients with HF, except in those with moderate or\nsevere mitral stenosis or mechanical prosthetic heart\nvalves.\nI\nFor patients with HF and non-valvular AF eligible for anti-\ncoagulation based on a CHA2DS2-VASc score, NOACs\nrather than warfarin should be considered for anticoagula-\ntion as NOACs are associated with a lower risk of stroke,\nintracranial haemorrhage, and mortality, which outweigh\nthe increased risk of gastrointestinal haemorrhage.\nIIa\nBeta-blockers should be considered for short- and long-\nterm rate control in patients with HF and AF.\nIIa\nFor patients in NYHA class I\u0002III, a beta-blocker, usually\ngiven orally, is safe and therefore is recommended as ﬁrst-\nline treatment to control ventricular rate, provided the\npatient is euvolaemic.\nI\nIn cases of a clear association between paroxysmal or\npersistent AF and worsening of HF symptoms, which\npersist despite medical therapy, catheter ablation should\nbe considered for the prevention or treatment of AF.\nIIa\nAV node catheter ablation may be considered to control\nheart rate and relieve symptoms in patients unresponsive\nor intolerant to intensive pharmacological rate and rhythm\ncontrol therapy, accepting that these patients will become\npacemaker-dependent.\nIIb\nRecommendations for management of patients with HF and CCS\nCoronary revascularization should be considered to\nrelieve persistent symptoms of angina (or an angina-\nequivalent) in patients with HFrEF, CCS, and coronary\nanatomy suitable for revascularization, despite OMT\nincluding anti-anginal drugs.\nIIa\nMyocardial revascularization is recommended when angina\npersists despite treatment with anti-anginal drugs.\nI\nRecommendations for management of patients with HF and diabetes\nSGLT2 inhibitors (canagliﬂozin, dapagliﬂozin, empagliﬂo-\nzin, ertugliﬂozin, sotagliﬂozin) are recommended in\npatients with T2DM at risk of CV events to reduce hospi-\ntalizations for HF, major CV events, end-stage renal dys-\nfunction, and CV death.\nI\nEmpagliﬂozin should be considered in patients with T2DM\nin order to prevent or delay the onset of HF and prolong\nlife.\nIIa\nAF = atrial ﬁbrillation; AHF = acute heart failure; AV = atrio-ventricular; BTB = bridge to bridge; BTD = bridge to decision; BTR = bridge to cardiac recovery; CAD = coronary\nartery disease; CCS = chronic coronary syndrome; CHA2DS2-VASc = congestive heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction, Hypertension, Age >_75 (doubled), Diabetes,\nStroke (doubled)-Vascular disease, Age 65\u000274, Sex category (female) (score); CRT = cardiac resynchronization therapy; CT = computed tomography; CTCA = computed\ntomography coronary angiography; CV = cardiovascular; DCM = dilated cardiomyopathy; DOAC = direct oral anticoagulant; HF = heart failure; HFrEF = heart failure with\nreduced ejection fraction; ICD = implantable cardioverter-deﬁbrillator; LBBB = left bundle branch block; LVEF = left ventricular ejection fraction; MCS = mechanical circulatory\nsupport; NOAC = non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant; NYHA = New York Heart Association; OMT = optimal medical therapy; QRS = Q, R, and S waves of an ECG;\nRV = right ventricular/ventricle; SBP = systolic blood pressure; SGLT2 = sodium-glucose co-transporter 2; T2DM = type 2 diabetes mellitus; VKA = vitamin K antagonist.\nESC 2021\n3612\nESC Guidelines\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/36/3599/6358045 by guest on 14 January 2026",

It is due to a structural and/or functional abnormality of the\nheart that results in elevated intracardiac pressures and/or inad-\nequate cardiac output at rest and/or during exercise.\nIdentification of the aetiology of the underlying cardiac dysfunction\nis mandatory in the diagnosis of HF as the specific pathology can\ndetermine subsequent treatment. Most commonly, HF is due to\nmyocardial dysfunction: either systolic, diastolic, or both. However,\npathology of the valves, pericardium, and endocardium, and abnor-\nmalities of heart rhythm and conduction can also cause or contribute\nto HF.\n3.2 Terminology\n3.2.1 Heart failure with preserved, mildly reduced, and\nreduced ejection fraction\nTraditionally, HF has been divided into distinct phenotypes based on\nthe measurement of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)\n(Table 3). The rationale behind this relates to the original treatment\ntrials in HF that demonstrated substantially improved outcomes in\npatients with LVEF <_40%. However, HF spans the entire range of\nLVEF (a normally distributed variable), and measurement by echocar-\ndiography is subject to substantial variability. We have decided on the\nfollowing classification of HF (Table 3):\n• Reduced LVEF is defined as <_40%, i.e. those with a significant\nreduction in LV systolic function. This is designated as HFrEF.\n• Patients with a LVEF between 41% and 49% have mildly reduced\nLV systolic function, i.e. HFmrEF. Retrospective analyses from\nRCTs in HFrEF or HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)\nthat have included patients with ejection fractions in the\n40\u000250% range suggest that they may benefit from similar\nRecommendations for management of patients with HF and AF\nDOACs are recommended in preference to VKAs in\npatients with HF, except in those with moderate or\nsevere mitral stenosis or mechanical prosthetic heart\nvalves.\nI\nFor patients with HF and non-valvular AF eligible for anti-\ncoagulation based on a CHA2DS2-VASc score, NOACs\nrather than warfarin should be considered for anticoagula-\ntion as NOACs are associated with a lower risk of stroke,\nintracranial haemorrhage, and mortality, which outweigh\nthe increased risk of gastrointestinal haemorrhage.\nIIa\nBeta-blockers should be considered for short- and long-\nterm rate control in patients with HF and AF.\nIIa\nFor patients in NYHA class I\u0002III, a beta-blocker, usually\ngiven orally, is safe and therefore is recommended as ﬁrst-\nline treatment to control ventricular rate, provided the\npatient is euvolaemic.\nI\nIn cases of a clear association between paroxysmal or\npersistent AF and worsening of HF symptoms, which\npersist despite medical therapy, catheter ablation should\nbe considered for the prevention or treatment of AF.\nIIa\nAV node catheter ablation may be considered to control\nheart rate and relieve symptoms in patients unresponsive\nor intolerant to intensive pharmacological rate and rhythm\ncontrol therapy, accepting that these patients will become\npacemaker-dependent.\nIIb\nRecommendations for management of patients with HF and CCS\nCoronary revascularization should be considered to\nrelieve persistent symptoms of angina (or an angina-\nequivalent) in patients with HFrEF, CCS, and coronary\nanatomy suitable for revascularization, despite OMT\nincluding anti-anginal drugs.\nIIa\nMyocardial revascularization is recommended when angina\npersists despite treatment with anti-anginal drugs.\nI\nRecommendations for management of patients with HF and diabetes\nSGLT2 inhibitors (canagliﬂozin, dapagliﬂozin, empagliﬂo-\nzin, ertugliﬂozin, sotagliﬂozin) are recommended in\npatients with T2DM at risk of CV events to reduce hospi-\ntalizations for HF, major CV events, end-stage renal dys-\nfunction, and CV death.\nI\nEmpagliﬂozin should be considered in patients with T2DM\nin order to prevent or delay the onset of HF and prolong\nlife.\nIIa\nAF = atrial ﬁbrillation; AHF = acute heart failure; AV = atrio-ventricular; BTB = bridge to bridge; BTD = bridge to decision; BTR = bridge to cardiac recovery; CAD = coronary\nartery disease; CCS = chronic coronary syndrome; CHA2DS2-VASc = congestive heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction, Hypertension, Age >_75 (doubled), Diabetes,\nStroke (doubled)-Vascular disease, Age 65\u000274, Sex category (female) (score); CRT = cardiac resynchronization therapy; CT = computed tomography; CTCA = computed\ntomography coronary angiography; CV = cardiovascular; DCM = dilated cardiomyopathy; DOAC = direct oral anticoagulant; HF = heart failure; HFrEF = heart failure with\nreduced ejection fraction; ICD = implantable cardioverter-deﬁbrillator; LBBB = left bundle branch block; LVEF = left ventricular ejection fraction; MCS = mechanical circulatory\nsupport; NOAC = non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant; NYHA = New York Heart Association; OMT = optimal medical therapy; QRS = Q, R, and S waves of an ECG;\nRV = right ventricular/ventricle; SBP = systolic blood pressure; SGLT2 = sodium-glucose co-transporter 2; T2DM = type 2 diabetes mellitus; VKA = vitamin K antagonist.\nESC 2021\n3612\nESC Guidelines\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/36/3599/6358045 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n..................................................................................................................\ntherapies to those with LVEF <_40%.8\u000213 This supports the\nrenaming of HFmrEF from ‘heart failure with mid-range ejection\nfraction’ to ‘heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction’.14\n• Those with symptoms and signs of HF, with evidence of\nstructural and/or functional cardiac abnormalities and/or raised\nnatriuretic peptides (NPs), and with an LVEF >_50%, have HFpEF.\nThe diagnosis of HFrEF, HFmrEF, and HFpEF is covered in more\ndetail in their respective sections (sections 5, 7, and 8, respectively).\nThese definitions are consistent with a recent report on the\nUniversal Definition of Heart Failure.15\nPatients with non-CV disease, e.g. anaemia, pulmonary, renal, thy-\nroid, or hepatic disease may have symptoms and signs very similar to\nthose of HF, but in the absence of cardiac dysfunction, they do not\nfulfil the criteria for HF. However, these pathologies can coexist with\nHF and exacerbate the HF syndrome.\n3.2.2 Right ventricular dysfunction\nHeart failure can also be a result of right ventricular (RV) dysfunc-\ntion. RV mechanics and function are altered in the setting of either\npressure or volume overload.16 Although the main aetiology of\nchronic RV failure is LV dysfunction-induced pulmonary hyperten-\nsion, there are a number of other causes of RV dysfunction [e.g.\nMI, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), or\nvalve disease].17 The diagnosis is determined by a quantitative\nassessment of global RV function, most commonly by echocar-\ndiography, using at least one of the following measurements: frac-\ntional area change (FAC); tricuspid annular plane systolic\nexcursion (TAPSE); and Doppler tissue imaging-derived systolic S0\nvelocity of the tricuspid annulus. The diagnosis and management\nof RV dysfunction is covered comprehensively in a recent Heart\nFailure Association (HFA) position paper.18\n3.2.3 Other common terminology used in heart failure\nHeart failure is usually divided into two presentations: chronic heart\nfailure (CHF) and acute heart failure (AHF). CHF describes those\nwho have had an established diagnosis of HF or who have a more\ngradual onset of symptoms. If CHF deteriorates, either suddenly or\nslowly, the episode may be described as ‘decompensated’ HF. This\ncan result in a hospital admission or treatment with intravenous (i.v.)\ndiuretic therapy in the outpatient setting. In addition, HF can present\nmore acutely. Both of these are considered in the section on AHF\n(section 11).\nSome individuals with HF may recover completely [e.g. those due\nto\nalcohol-induced\ncardiomyopathy\n(CMP),\nviral\nmyocarditis,\nTakotsubo syndrome, peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM), or\ntachycardiomyopathy]. Other patients with LV systolic dysfunction\nmay show a substantial or even complete recovery of LV systolic\nfunction after receiving drug and device therapy.\n3.2.4 Terminology related to the symptomatic severity of\nheart failure\nThe simplest terminology used to describe the severity of HF is the\nNew York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification\n(Table 4). However, this relies solely on symptoms and there are\nmany other better prognostic indicators in HF.19 Importantly,\npatients with mild symptoms may still have a high risk of hospitaliza-\ntion and death.20 Predicting outcome is particularly important in\nadvanced HF to guide selection of cardiac transplantation and device\ntherapies. This will be covered in detail in the section on advanced\nHF (section 10).\n3.3 Epidemiology and natural history of\nheart failure\n3.3.1 Incidence and prevalence\nIn developed countries, the age-adjusted incidence of HF may be fall-\ning, presumably reflecting better management of CV disease, but due\nto ageing, the overall incidence is increasing.21\u000224 Currently, the inci-\ndence of HF in Europe is about 3/1000 person-years (all age-groups)\nor about 5/1000 person-years in adults.25,26 The prevalence of HF\nappears to be 1\u00022% of adults.21,27\u000231 As studies only usually include\nrecognized/diagnosed HF cases, the true prevalence is likely to be\nhigher.32 The prevalence increases with age: from around 1% for\nthose aged <55 years to >10% in those aged 70 years or over.33\u000236 It\nTable 3\nDeﬁnition of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, mildly reduced ejection fraction and preserved ejection\nfraction\nType of HF\nHFrEF\nHFmrEF\nHFpEF\nCRITERIA\n1\nSymptoms ± Signsa\nSymptoms ± Signsa\nSymptoms ± Signsa\n2\nLVEF <_40%\nLVEF 41\u000249%b\nLVEF >_50%\n3\n\u0002\n\u0002\nObjective evidence of cardiac structural and/or functional\nabnormalities consistent with the presence of LV diastolic\ndysfunction/raised LV ﬁlling pressures, including raised natriuretic peptidesc\nHF = heart failure; HFmrEF = heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction; HFpEF = heart failure with preserved ejection fraction; HFrEF = heart failure with reduced ejec-\ntion fraction; LV = left ventricle; LVEF = left ventricular ejection fraction.\naSigns may not be present in the early stages of HF (especially in HFpEF) and in optimally treated patients.\nbFor the diagnosis of HFmrEF, the presence of other evidence of structural heart disease (e.g. increased left atrial size, LV hypertrophy or echocardiographic measures of\nimpaired LV ﬁlling) makes the diagnosis more likely.\ncFor the diagnosis of HFpEF, the greater the number of abnormalities present, the higher the likelihood of HFpEF.\nESC 2021\nESC Guidelines\n3613\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/36/3599/6358045 by guest on 14 January 2026",

The improvement in prognosis has been confined to those\nwith HFrEF.\nMortality rates are higher in observational studies than in clinical\ntrials.44 In the Olmsted County cohort, 1-year and 5-year mortality\nrates after diagnosis, for all types of HF patients, were 20% and 53%,\nrespectively, between 2000 and 2010.45 A study combining the\nFramingham Heart Study (FHS) and Cardiovascular Health Study\n(CHS) cohorts reported a 67% mortality rate within 5 years following\ndiagnosis.46 Despite receiving less evidence-based treatment, women\nhave a better survival than men.47\nOverall prognosis is better in HFmrEF compared to HFrEF.39 Of\nnote, transition in ejection fraction over time is common, and patients\nwho progress from HFmrEF to HFrEF have a worse prognosis than\nthose who remain stable or transition to a higher ejection fraction\ncategory.48\u000252\nHFpEF is generally considered to confer a better survival than\nHFrEF, but most observational studies show that this difference is\nnegligible.45,46 In contrast, the large MAGGIC meta-analysis con-\ncluded that the adjusted mortality risk for patients with HFpEF was\nconsiderably lower than in patients with HFrEF.53\nStudies from several countries have shown that between 1980 and\n2000 survival in HF patients has improved markedly.41,54\u000257\nHowever, this positive trend may have levelled off since then.45\nAfter the initial diagnosis, HF patients are hospitalized once every\nyear on average.54 From 2000 to 2010, the mean rate of hospitaliza-\ntion in the Olmsted County cohort was 1.3 per person-year.\nInterestingly, the majority (63%) of hospitalizations were related to\nnon-CV causes.45 Studies from several European countries and the\nUnited States (US) have shown that HF hospitalization rates peaked\nin the 1990s, and then declined.54,55*,58\u000260 However, in a recent\nstudy of incident HF conducted between 1998 and 2017 in the\nUnited Kingdom (UK), age-adjusted rates of first hospitalizations\nincreased by 28% for both all-cause and HF admissions, and by 42%\nfor non-CV admissions.61 These increases were higher in women,\nperhaps related to higher comorbidity rates. The risk of HF hospital-\nization is 1.5 times higher in patients with diabetes compared to con-\ntrols. AF, a higher body mass index (BMI), and higher glycated\nhaemoglobin (HbA1c), as well as a low estimated glomerular filtra-\ntion rate (eGFR) are strong predictors of HF hospitalizations.29\nDue to population growth, ageing, and the increasing prevalence\nof comorbidities, the absolute number of hospital admissions for HF\nis expected to increase considerably in the future, perhaps by as\nmuch as 50% in the next 25 years.24,62\n4 Chronic heart failure\n4.1 Key steps in the diagnosis of chronic\nheart failure\nThe diagnosis of CHF requires the presence of symptoms and/or\nsigns of HF and objective evidence of cardiac dysfunction (Figure 1).\nTypical symptoms include breathlessness, fatigue, and ankle swelling\n(Table 6). Symptoms and signs lack sufficient accuracy to be used\nalone to make the diagnosis of HF.63\u000266\nThe diagnosis of CHF is made more likely in patients with a history\nof MI, arterial hypertension, CAD, diabetes mellitus, alcohol misuse,\nchronic kidney disease (CKD), cardiotoxic chemotherapy, and in\nthose with a family history of CMP or sudden death.\nThe following diagnostic tests are recommended for the assess-\nment of patients with suspected chronic HF:\n(1)\nElectrocardiogram (ECG). A normal ECG makes the diagnosis of\nHF unlikely.63 The ECG may reveal abnormalities such as AF, Q\nwaves, LV hypertrophy (LVH), and a widened QRS complex\n(Table 7) that increase the likelihood of a diagnosis of HF and also\nmay guide therapy.\nTable 4\nNew York Heart Association functional\nclassiﬁcation based on severity of symptoms and\nphysical activity\nClass I\nNo limitation of physical activity.

They should be uptitrated to\nthe maximum tolerated recommended doses.\nPractical guidance on how to use ACE-Is is given in Supplementary\nTable 2.\n5.3.2\nBeta-blockers\nBeta-blockers have been shown to reduce mortality and morbidity in\npatients with HFrEF, in addition to treatment with an ACE-I and diu-\nretic.114\u0002120 They also improve symptoms.123 There is consensus\nthat ACE-I and beta-blockers can be commenced together as soon\nas the diagnosis of symptomatic HFrEF is established. There is no evi-\ndence favouring the initiation of a beta-blocker before an ACE-I and\nvice versa.124 Beta-blockers should be initiated in clinically stable,\neuvolaemic, patients at a low dose and gradually uptitrated to the\nmaximum tolerated dose. In patients admitted with AHF, beta-\nblockers should be cautiously initiated in hospital, once the patient is\nhaemodynamically stabilized.\nAn individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis of all major beta-\nblocker trials in HFrEF has shown no benefit on hospital admissions\nand mortality in the subgroup of patients with HFrEF with AF.125\nHowever, since this is a retrospective subgroup analysis, and because\nbeta-blockers did not increase risk, the guideline committee decided\nnot to make a separate recommendation according to heart rhythm.\nPractical guidance on how to use beta-blockers is given in\nSupplementary Table 3.\n5.3.3\nMineralocorticoid receptor antagonists\nMRAs (spironolactone or eplerenone) are recommended, in addition\nto an ACE-I and a beta-blocker, in all patients with HFrEF to reduce\nmortality and the risk of HF hospitalization.121,122 They also improve\nsymptoms.121 MRAs block receptors that bind aldosterone and, with\ndifferent degrees of affinity, other steroid hormones (e.g. corticoste-\nroid and androgen) receptors. Eplerenone is more specific for aldos-\nterone blockade and, therefore, causes less gynaecomastia.\nCaution should be exercised when MRAs are used in patients with\nimpaired renal function and in those with serum potassium concen-\ntrations >5.0 mmol/L.\nPractical guidance on how to use MRAs is given in Supplementary\nTable 4.\n5.3.4\nAngiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor\nIn the PARADIGM-HF trial, sacubitril/valsartan, an ARNI, was shown\nto be superior to enalapril in reducing hospitalizations for worsening\nHF, CV mortality, and all-cause mortality in patients with ambulatory\nHFrEF with LVEF <_40% (changed to <_35% during the study). Patients\nin the trial had elevated plasma NP concentrations, an eGFR >_30 mL/\nmin/1.73 m2 and were able to tolerate enalapril and then sacubitril/\nvalsartan during the run-in period.105 Additional benefits of sacubitril/\nvalsartan included an improvement in symptoms and QOL,105 a\nreduction in the incidence of diabetes requiring insulin treatment,126\nand a reduction in the decline in eGFR,127 as well as a reduced rate of\nhyperkalaemia.128 Additionally, the use of sacubitril/valsartan may\nallow a reduction in loop diuretic requirement.129 Symptomatic\nhypotension was reported more commonly in patients treated with\nsacubitril/valsartan as compared to enalapril, but despite developing\nhypotension, these patients also gained clinical benefits from sacubi-\ntril/valsartan therapy.128,130\nTable 8\nEvidence-based doses of disease-modifying drugs\nin key randomized trials in patients with heart failure with\nreduced ejection fraction\nStarting dose\nTarget dose\nACE-I\nCaptoprila\n6.25 mg t.i.d.\n50 mg t.i.d.\nEnalapril\n2.5 mg b.i.d.\n10\u000220 mg b.i.d.\nLisinoprilb\n2.5\u00025 mg o.d.\n20\u000235 mg o.d.\nRamipril\n2.5 mg b.i.d.\n5 mg b.i.d.\nTrandolaprila\n0.5 mg o.d.\n4 mg o.d.\nARNI\nSacubitril/valsartan\n49/51 mg b.i.d.c\n97/103 mg b.i.d.\nBeta-blockers\nBisoprolol\n1.25 mg o.d.\n10 mg o.d.\nCarvedilol\n3.125 mg b.i.d.\n25 mg b.i.d.e\nMetoprolol succinate\n(CR/XL)\n12.5\u000225 mg o.d.\n200 mg o.d.\nNebivolold\n1.25 mg o.d.\n10 mg o.d.\nMRA\nEplerenone\n25 mg o.d.\n50 mg o.d.\nSpironolactone\n25 mg o.d.f\n50 mg o.d.\nSGLT2 inhibitor\nDapagliﬂozin\n10 mg o.d.\n10 mg o.d.\nEmpagliﬂozin\n10 mg o.d.\n10 mg o.d.\nOther agents\nCandesartan\n4 mg o.d.\n32 mg o.d.\nLosartan\n50 mg o.d.\n150 mg o.d.\nValsartan\n40 mg b.i.d.\n160 mg b.i.d.\nIvabradine\n5 mg b.i.d.\n7.5 mg b.i.d.\nVericiguat\n2.5 mg o.d.\n10 mg o.d.\nDigoxin\n62.5 mg o.d.\n250 mg o.d.\nHydralazine/\nIsosorbide dinitrate\n37.5 mg t.i.d./20 mg t.i.d.\n75 mg t.i.d./40 mg t.i.d.\nACE-I = angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor; ARNI = angiotensin receptor-\nneprilysin inhibitor; b.i.d. = bis in die (twice daily); CR = controlled release; CV =\ncardiovascular; MRA = mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist; o.d. = omne in die\n(once daily); SGLT2 = sodium-glucose co-transporter 2; t.i.d. = ter in die (three\ntimes a day); XL = extended release.\naIndicates an ACE-I where the dosing target is derived from post-myocardial\ninfarction trials.\nbIndicates drugs where a higher dose has been shown to reduce morbidity/mor-\ntality compared with a lower dose of the same drug, but there is no substantive\nrandomized, placebo-controlled trial and the optimum dose is uncertain.\ncSacubitril/valsartan may have an optional lower starting dose of 24/26 mg b.i.d.\nfor those with a history of symptomatic hypotension.\ndIndicates a treatment not shown to reduce CV or all-cause mortality in patients\nwith heart failure (or shown to be non-inferior to a treatment that does).\neA maximum dose of 50 mg twice daily can be administered to patients weighing\nover 85 kg.\nfSpironolactone has an optional starting dose of 12.5 mg in patients where renal\nstatus or hyperkalaemia warrant caution.\nESC 2021\nESC Guidelines\n3621\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/36/3599/6358045 by guest on 14 January 2026",

Patients\nin the trial had elevated plasma NP concentrations, an eGFR >_30 mL/\nmin/1.73 m2 and were able to tolerate enalapril and then sacubitril/\nvalsartan during the run-in period.105 Additional benefits of sacubitril/\nvalsartan included an improvement in symptoms and QOL,105 a\nreduction in the incidence of diabetes requiring insulin treatment,126\nand a reduction in the decline in eGFR,127 as well as a reduced rate of\nhyperkalaemia.128 Additionally, the use of sacubitril/valsartan may\nallow a reduction in loop diuretic requirement.129 Symptomatic\nhypotension was reported more commonly in patients treated with\nsacubitril/valsartan as compared to enalapril, but despite developing\nhypotension, these patients also gained clinical benefits from sacubi-\ntril/valsartan therapy.128,130\nTable 8\nEvidence-based doses of disease-modifying drugs\nin key randomized trials in patients with heart failure with\nreduced ejection fraction\nStarting dose\nTarget dose\nACE-I\nCaptoprila\n6.25 mg t.i.d.\n50 mg t.i.d.\nEnalapril\n2.5 mg b.i.d.\n10\u000220 mg b.i.d.\nLisinoprilb\n2.5\u00025 mg o.d.\n20\u000235 mg o.d.\nRamipril\n2.5 mg b.i.d.\n5 mg b.i.d.\nTrandolaprila\n0.5 mg o.d.\n4 mg o.d.\nARNI\nSacubitril/valsartan\n49/51 mg b.i.d.c\n97/103 mg b.i.d.\nBeta-blockers\nBisoprolol\n1.25 mg o.d.\n10 mg o.d.\nCarvedilol\n3.125 mg b.i.d.\n25 mg b.i.d.e\nMetoprolol succinate\n(CR/XL)\n12.5\u000225 mg o.d.\n200 mg o.d.\nNebivolold\n1.25 mg o.d.\n10 mg o.d.\nMRA\nEplerenone\n25 mg o.d.\n50 mg o.d.\nSpironolactone\n25 mg o.d.f\n50 mg o.d.\nSGLT2 inhibitor\nDapagliﬂozin\n10 mg o.d.\n10 mg o.d.\nEmpagliﬂozin\n10 mg o.d.\n10 mg o.d.\nOther agents\nCandesartan\n4 mg o.d.\n32 mg o.d.\nLosartan\n50 mg o.d.\n150 mg o.d.\nValsartan\n40 mg b.i.d.\n160 mg b.i.d.\nIvabradine\n5 mg b.i.d.\n7.5 mg b.i.d.\nVericiguat\n2.5 mg o.d.\n10 mg o.d.\nDigoxin\n62.5 mg o.d.\n250 mg o.d.\nHydralazine/\nIsosorbide dinitrate\n37.5 mg t.i.d./20 mg t.i.d.\n75 mg t.i.d./40 mg t.i.d.\nACE-I = angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor; ARNI = angiotensin receptor-\nneprilysin inhibitor; b.i.d. = bis in die (twice daily); CR = controlled release; CV =\ncardiovascular; MRA = mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist; o.d. = omne in die\n(once daily); SGLT2 = sodium-glucose co-transporter 2; t.i.d. = ter in die (three\ntimes a day); XL = extended release.\naIndicates an ACE-I where the dosing target is derived from post-myocardial\ninfarction trials.\nbIndicates drugs where a higher dose has been shown to reduce morbidity/mor-\ntality compared with a lower dose of the same drug, but there is no substantive\nrandomized, placebo-controlled trial and the optimum dose is uncertain.\ncSacubitril/valsartan may have an optional lower starting dose of 24/26 mg b.i.d.\nfor those with a history of symptomatic hypotension.\ndIndicates a treatment not shown to reduce CV or all-cause mortality in patients\nwith heart failure (or shown to be non-inferior to a treatment that does).\neA maximum dose of 50 mg twice daily can be administered to patients weighing\nover 85 kg.\nfSpironolactone has an optional starting dose of 12.5 mg in patients where renal\nstatus or hyperkalaemia warrant caution.\nESC 2021\nESC Guidelines\n3621\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/36/3599/6358045 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n.............................\nTherefore, it is recommended that an ACE-I or ARB is replaced by\nsacubitril/valsartan in ambulatory patients with HFrEF, who remain\nsymptomatic despite optimal treatment outlined above.

Patients\nwere also required to have an elevated plasma NT-proBNP and an\neGFR >_30 mL/min/1.73 m2.108\nTherapy with dapagliflozin resulted in a 26% reduction in the pri-\nmary endpoint: a composite of worsening HF (hospitalization or an\nurgent visit resulting in i.v. therapy for HF) or CV death. Both of these\ncomponents were significantly reduced. Moreover, dapagliflozin\nreduced all-cause mortality,108 alleviated HF symptoms, improved\nphysical function and QOL in patients with symptomatic HFrEF.132\nBenefits were seen early after the initiation of dapagliflozin, and the\nabsolute risk reduction was large. Survival benefits were seen to the\nsame extent in patients with HFrEF with and without diabetes, and\nacross the whole spectrum of HbA1c values.108\nSubsequently, the EMPEROR-Reduced trial found that empagliflo-\nzin reduced the combined primary endpoint of CV death or HF hos-\npitalization by 25% in patients with NYHA class II\u0002IV symptoms, and\nan LVEF <_40% despite OMT.109 This trial included patients with an\neGFR >20 mL/min/1.73 m2 and there was also a reduction in the\ndecline in eGFR in individuals receiving empagliflozin.

The diuretic/\nnatriuretic properties of SGLT2 inhibitors may offer additional bene-\nfits in reducing congestion and may allow a reduction in loop diuretic\nrequirement.135\nThe combined SGLT-1 and 2 inhibitor, sotagliflozin, has also been\nstudied in patients with diabetes who were hospitalized with HF.

Patients being commenced on sacubitril/valsartan should have an\nadequate blood pressure (BP), and an eGFR >_30 mL/min/1.73 m2. A\nwashout period of at least 36 h after ACE-I therapy is required in\norder to minimize the risk of angioedema.\nPractical guidance on how to use ARNI is given in Supplementary\nTable 5.\n5.3.5\nSodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors\nThe DAPA-HF trial investigated the long-term effects of dapagliflozin\n(SGLT2 inhibitor) compared to placebo in addition to optimal medi-\ncal therapy (OMT), on morbidity and mortality in patients with ambu-\nlatory HFrEF.108 Patients participated in the trial if they were in\nNYHA class II\u0002IV, and had an LVEF <_40% despite OMT. Patients\nwere also required to have an elevated plasma NT-proBNP and an\neGFR >_30 mL/min/1.73 m2.108\nTherapy with dapagliflozin resulted in a 26% reduction in the pri-\nmary endpoint: a composite of worsening HF (hospitalization or an\nurgent visit resulting in i.v. therapy for HF) or CV death. Both of these\ncomponents were significantly reduced. Moreover, dapagliflozin\nreduced all-cause mortality,108 alleviated HF symptoms, improved\nphysical function and QOL in patients with symptomatic HFrEF.132\nBenefits were seen early after the initiation of dapagliflozin, and the\nabsolute risk reduction was large. Survival benefits were seen to the\nsame extent in patients with HFrEF with and without diabetes, and\nacross the whole spectrum of HbA1c values.108\nSubsequently, the EMPEROR-Reduced trial found that empagliflo-\nzin reduced the combined primary endpoint of CV death or HF hos-\npitalization by 25% in patients with NYHA class II\u0002IV symptoms, and\nan LVEF <_40% despite OMT.109 This trial included patients with an\neGFR >20 mL/min/1.73 m2 and there was also a reduction in the\ndecline in eGFR in individuals receiving empagliflozin. It was also asso-\nciated with an improvement in QOL.133 Although there was not a\nsignificant reduction in CV mortality in the EMPEROR-Reduced trial,\na recent meta-analysis of the DAPA-HF and EMPEROR-Reduced tri-\nals found no heterogeneity in CV mortality.134\nTherefore, dapagliflozin or empagliflozin are recommended, in\naddition to OMT with an ACE-I/ARNI, a beta-blocker and an MRA,\nfor patients with HFrEF regardless of diabetes status. The diuretic/\nnatriuretic properties of SGLT2 inhibitors may offer additional bene-\nfits in reducing congestion and may allow a reduction in loop diuretic\nrequirement.135\nThe combined SGLT-1 and 2 inhibitor, sotagliflozin, has also been\nstudied in patients with diabetes who were hospitalized with HF. The\ndrug reduced CV death and hospitalization for HF.136 It is discussed\nfurther in the AHF and comorbidity sections.\nTherapy with SGLT2 inhibitors may increase the risk of recurrent\ngenital fungal infections. A small reduction in eGFR following initiation\nis expected and is reversible and should not lead to premature dis-\ncontinuation of the drug.\nPractical guidance on how to use the SGLT2 inhibitors dapagliflo-\nzin and empagliflozin are given in Supplementary Table 6.\n5.4 Other drugs recommended or to be\nconsidered in selected patients with\nheart failure with reduced ejection\nfraction\nOther pharmacological treatments indicated in selected\npatients with NYHA class II–IV heart failure with\nreduced ejection fraction (LVEF \u000340%)\nRecommendations\nClassa\nLevelb\nLoop diuretics\nDiuretics are recommended in patients with\nHFrEF with signs and/or symptoms of congestion\nto alleviate HF symptoms, improve exercise\ncapacity, and reduce HF hospitalizations.137\nI\nC\nARB\nAn ARBc is recommended to reduce the risk of\nHF hospitalization and CV death in symptomatic\npatients unable to tolerate an ACE-I or ARNI\n(patients should also receive a beta-blocker and\nan MRA).138\nI\nB\nIf-channel inhibitor\nIvabradine should be considered in symptomatic\npatients with LVEF <_35%, in SR and a resting\nheart rate >_70 b.p.m. despite treatment with an\nevidence-based dose of beta-blocker (or maxi-\nmum tolerated dose below that), ACE-I/(or\nARNI), and an MRA, to reduce the risk of HF\nhospitalization and CV death.139\nIIa\nB\nIvabradine should be considered in symptomatic\npatients with LVEF <_35%, in SR and a resting\nheart rate >_70 b.p.m. who are unable to tolerate\nor have contraindications for a beta-blocker to\nreduce the risk of HF hospitalization and CV\ndeath.

The quality of the evi-\ndence regarding diuretics is poor and their effects on morbidity and\nmortality have not been studied in RCTs. However, it should also be\nremembered that the major disease-modifying treatment trials for\nHFrEF were conducted with a high background use of loop diuretic\ntherapy. One meta-analysis has shown that in patients with HFrEF,\nloop and thiazide diuretics appear to reduce the risk of death and\nworsening HF compared with a placebo, and compared with an\nactive control, diuretics improve exercise capacity.137\nLoop diuretics produce a more intense and shorter diuresis than\nthiazides, although they act synergistically (sequential nephron block-\nade) and the combination may be used to treat diuretic resistance.\nHowever, adverse effects are more likely, and these combinations\nshould only be used with care. Of note, ARNI, MRAs, and SGLT2\ninhibitors may also possess diuretic properties.129,145\nThe aim of diuretic therapy is to achieve and maintain euvolaemia\nwith the lowest diuretic dose. In some euvolaemic/hypovolaemic\npatients, the use of a diuretic drug might be reduced or discontin-\nued.146 Patients should be trained to self-adjust their diuretic dose\nbased on monitoring of symptoms/signs of congestion and daily\nweight measurements.\nPractical\nguidance\non\nhow\nto\nuse\ndiuretics\nis\ngiven\nin\nSupplementary Table 7.\n5.4.2\nAngiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers\nThe place of ARBs in the management of HFrEF has changed over\nthe last few years.

A small RCT conducted in\nself-identified black patients showed that an addition of the combina-\ntion of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate to conventional therapy\n(an ACE-I, a beta-blocker, and an MRA) reduced mortality and HF\nhospitalizations in patients with HFrEF and NYHA classes III\u0002IV.142\nThese results are difficult to translate to patients of other racial or\nethnic origins.\nAdditionally, a combination of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate\nmay be considered in symptomatic patients with HFrEF who cannot\ntolerate any of an ACE-I, ARNI, or an ARB (or if they are contraindi-\ncated) to reduce mortality. However, this recommendation is based\non the results of the relatively small Veterans Administration\nCooperative Study, which included only male patients with sympto-\nmatic HFrEF who were treated with digoxin and diuretics.143\n5.4.5\nDigoxin\nDigoxin may be considered in patients with HFrEF in SR to reduce\nthe risk of hospitalization,144 although its effect on those routinely\ntreated with beta-blockers has not been tested. In the DIG trial, the\noverall effect on mortality with digoxin was neutral.\nThe effects of digoxin in patients with HFrEF and AF have not been\nstudied in RCTs. Some studies have suggested a potentially higher\nrisk of events in patients with AF receiving digoxin,149,150 whereas\nanother meta-analysis concluded, on the basis of non-RCTs, that\ndigoxin has no deleterious effect on mortality in patients with AF and\nHF, most of whom had HFrEF.151 Therefore, in patients with sympto-\nmatic HF and AF, digoxin may be useful for the treatment of patients\nwith HFrEF and AF with rapid ventricular rate, when other therapeu-\ntic options cannot be pursued.150,152\u0002155\nDigoxin has a narrow therapeutic window and so levels should be\nchecked aiming for a serum digoxin concentration <1.2 ng/mL.156,157\nCaution should also be exercised when using it in females, the elderly,\nfrail, hypokalaemic, and malnourished subjects.

The quality of the evi-\ndence regarding diuretics is poor and their effects on morbidity and\nmortality have not been studied in RCTs. However, it should also be\nremembered that the major disease-modifying treatment trials for\nHFrEF were conducted with a high background use of loop diuretic\ntherapy. One meta-analysis has shown that in patients with HFrEF,\nloop and thiazide diuretics appear to reduce the risk of death and\nworsening HF compared with a placebo, and compared with an\nactive control, diuretics improve exercise capacity.137\nLoop diuretics produce a more intense and shorter diuresis than\nthiazides, although they act synergistically (sequential nephron block-\nade) and the combination may be used to treat diuretic resistance.\nHowever, adverse effects are more likely, and these combinations\nshould only be used with care. Of note, ARNI, MRAs, and SGLT2\ninhibitors may also possess diuretic properties.129,145\nThe aim of diuretic therapy is to achieve and maintain euvolaemia\nwith the lowest diuretic dose.

Ivabradine\nreduced the combined endpoint of CV mortality and HF hospitaliza-\ntion in patients with symptomatic HFrEF with an LVEF <_35%, with HF\nhospitalization in recent 12 months, in sinus rhythm (SR) and with a\nheart rate >_70 b.p.m. who were on evidence-based therapy including\nan ACE-I (or ARB), a beta-blocker, and an MRA.139,140 Our recom-\nmendation is based on the heart rate of >_70 b.p.m. used in the SHIFT\ntrial. However, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved\nivabradine for use in Europe in patients with HFrEF with LVEF <_35%\nand in SR with a resting heart rate >_75 b.p.m., because in this group\nivabradine conferred a survival benefit148 based on a retrospective\nsubgroup analysis. Every effort should be made to commence and\nuptitrate beta-blocker therapy to guideline recommended/maximally\ntolerated doses prior to considering ivabradine.\nPractical guidance on how to use ivabradine is given in\nSupplementary Table 8.\n5.4.4\nCombination of hydralazine and isosorbide\ndinitrate\nThere is no clear evidence to suggest the use of this fixed-dose com-\nbination therapy in all patients with HFrEF. A small RCT conducted in\nself-identified black patients showed that an addition of the combina-\ntion of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate to conventional therapy\n(an ACE-I, a beta-blocker, and an MRA) reduced mortality and HF\nhospitalizations in patients with HFrEF and NYHA classes III\u0002IV.142\nThese results are difficult to translate to patients of other racial or\nethnic origins.\nAdditionally, a combination of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate\nmay be considered in symptomatic patients with HFrEF who cannot\ntolerate any of an ACE-I, ARNI, or an ARB (or if they are contraindi-\ncated) to reduce mortality. However, this recommendation is based\non the results of the relatively small Veterans Administration\nCooperative Study, which included only male patients with sympto-\nmatic HFrEF who were treated with digoxin and diuretics.143\n5.4.5\nDigoxin\nDigoxin may be considered in patients with HFrEF in SR to reduce\nthe risk of hospitalization,144 although its effect on those routinely\ntreated with beta-blockers has not been tested. In the DIG trial, the\noverall effect on mortality with digoxin was neutral.\nThe effects of digoxin in patients with HFrEF and AF have not been\nstudied in RCTs. Some studies have suggested a potentially higher\nrisk of events in patients with AF receiving digoxin,149,150 whereas\nanother meta-analysis concluded, on the basis of non-RCTs, that\ndigoxin has no deleterious effect on mortality in patients with AF and\nHF, most of whom had HFrEF.151 Therefore, in patients with sympto-\nmatic HF and AF, digoxin may be useful for the treatment of patients\nwith HFrEF and AF with rapid ventricular rate, when other therapeu-\ntic options cannot be pursued.150,152\u0002155\nDigoxin has a narrow therapeutic window and so levels should be\nchecked aiming for a serum digoxin concentration <1.2 ng/mL.156,157\nCaution should also be exercised when using it in females, the elderly,\nfrail, hypokalaemic, and malnourished subjects. In patients with\nreduced renal function, digitoxin could be considered. Digitoxin use\nin HF and SR is currently being investigated.158\nHydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate may be con-\nsidered in patients with symptomatic HFrEF who\ncannot tolerate any of an ACE-I, an ARB, or\nARNI (or they are contraindicated) to reduce\nthe risk of death.143\nIIb\nB\nDigoxin\nDigoxin may be considered in patients with\nsymptomatic HFrEF in sinus rhythm despite\ntreatment with an ACE-I (or ARNI), a beta-\nblocker and an MRA, to reduce the risk of hospi-\ntalization (both all-cause and HF\nhospitalizations).144\nIIb\nB\nACE-I = angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor; ARB = angiotensin-receptor\nblocker; ARNI = angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor; b.p.m. = beats per\nminute; CV = cardiovascular; HF = heart failure; HFrEF = heart failure with\nreduced ejection fraction; LVEF = left ventricular ejection fraction; MRA = minera-\nlocorticoid receptor antagonist; NYHA = New York Heart Association; SR =\nsinus rhythm.\naClass of recommendation.\nbLevel of evidence.\ncThe ARBs with evidence in HFrEF are candesartan, losartan, and valsartan.\nESC 2021\nESC Guidelines\n3623\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/36/3599/6358045 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\nDiuretics\nSR with LBBB ≥ 150 ms\nTo reduce mortality - for all patients\nTo reduce HF hospitalization/mortality - for selected patients\nVolume overload\nACE-I/ARNI\nBB\nMRA\nSGLT2i\nExercise rehabilitation\nTo reduce HF hospitalization and improve QOL - for all patients\nFor selected advanced HF patients\nCRT-P/D\nAtrial fibrillation\nAnticoagulation\nMCS as BTT/BTC\nAortic stenosis\nSAVR/TAVI\nMitral regurgitation\nTEE MV Repair\nHeart rate SR>70 bpm\nIvabradine\nBlack Race\nHydralazine/ISDN\nACE-I/ARNI intolerance\nARB\nAtrial fibrillation\nDigoxin\nCoronary artery disease\nCABG\nIron deficiency\nFerric carboxymaltose\nICD\nIschaemic aetiology\nHeart transplantation\nLong-term MCS as DT\nMulti-professional disease management\nNon-ischaemic aetiology\nSR with LBBB 130–149 ms or non LBBB ≥ 150 ms\nCRT-P/D\nManagement of HFrEF\nICD\nPVI\nFigure 3 Central illustration.

An ICD is recom-\nmended in such patients when the intent is to increase survival; the\ndecision to implant should take into account the patient’s view and\ntheir QOL, the LVEF (survival benefit is uncertain when LVEF >35%)\nand the absence of other diseases likely to cause death within the fol-\nlowing year.162\u0002164,184\n6.1.2\nPrimary prevention of sudden cardiac death\nIn an analysis of over 40 000 patients from 12 pivotal HF trials, rates\nof sudden cardiac death decreased by 44% over the 20-year period\n(from the mid-1990s to 2015).160 This is almost certainly due to\nadvances in HF treatment, as many key guideline-recommended\ntherapies, including beta-blockers, MRAs, sacubitril/valsartan, and\nCRT pacemakers (CRT-P), reduce the risk of sudden death. While\nthe afore-mentioned HF therapies have been shown to reduce mor-\ntality in patients with HFrEF, amiodarone has not.161 However, if it is\nto be used, it should be with caution due to its significant side-effect\nprofile. Conversely, dronedarone185 and the class I antiarrhythmic\nagents disopyramide, encainide, and flecainide186 should not be used\nfor prevention of arrhythmias due to the increase in mortality seen in\nclinical studies.\nAlthough an ICD reduces the rate of sudden arrhythmic death in\npatients with HFrEF,187 it would be expected that, in well-managed\npatients, the additional benefit afforded by an ICD would be lower. In\nthe DANISH trial, rates of sudden death were low in patients with non-\nischaemic cardiomyopathy (NICM); only 70 patients out of 1116 fol-\nlowed up over 5 years had sudden death.166 Whilst there was a modest\nabsolute reduction in sudden death with a defibrillator-containing\ndevice, this did not significantly improve the overall risk of mortality.\nHowever, subgroup analysis suggested there was a benefit in those <_70\nyears.188 In a recent meta-analysis of studies that examined the effect of\nICDs in NICM a survival benefit was still seen, although the effect was\nsignificantly weakened by the inclusion of the DANISH trial.167\nOn average, patients with IHD are at greater risk of sudden death\nthan patients with NICM and therefore, although the relative benefits\nare similar, the absolute benefit is greater in patients with IHD.187 Two\nRCTs showed no benefit in patients who had an ICD implanted within\n40 days after a MI.177,178 Although sudden arrhythmic deaths were\nreduced, this was balanced by an increase in non-arrhythmic deaths.\nAccordingly, an ICD for primary prevention is contraindicated in this\ntime period. Furthermore, ICD implantation is recommended only if a\nminimum of 3 months of OMT has failed to increase the LVEF to\n>35%. OMT ideally includes the use of Class I recommended drugs for\nHFrEF. However, the ICD trials we cite predate the use of ARNI and\nSGLT2 inhibitors. Whether implantation of ICDs reduces mortality in\nthose with an LVEF >35% is unknown. There is an ongoing trial of ICD\ntherapy in such patients with the presence of scar on CMR imaging.189\n6.1.3\nPatient selection for implantable cardioverter-\ndefibrillator therapy\nPatients with HFrEF and a QRS duration >_130 ms can be considered\nfor CRT with a defibrillator (CRT-D) rather than ICD. See the sec-\ntion on CRT for further details (section 6.2).\nIn patients with moderate or severe HF, a reduction in sudden\ndeath may be partially or wholly offset by an increase in death due to\nworsening HF.161 As such, ICD therapy is not recommended in\npatients in NYHA class IV, with severe symptoms refractory to phar-\nmacological therapy, who are not candidates for a ventricular assist\ndevice (VAD) or cardiac transplantation. Such patients have a very\nlimited life expectancy and are likely to die from pump failure.\nSimilarly, patients with serious comorbidities who are unlikely to sur-\nvive substantially more than 1 year with good QOL are unlikely to\nobtain substantial benefit from an ICD.179\u0002183\nAlthough the DANISH trial did not show a significant benefit from\nICD therapy in patients with NICM, it should be remembered that\nNICM is a heterogeneous condition, and certain subgroups (e.g. lami-\nnopathies, sarcoidosis) are at higher risk of sudden death and there-\nfore merit careful consideration of ICD implantation. Tools to help\nrisk stratification (e.g. scar burden on magnetic resonance imaging)\ncan be helpful in that regard.190\u0002192\nPatients should be counselled as to the purpose of an ICD and\ninvolved in the decision-making process. They should also be aware of\nthe potential complications related to implantation, any additional impli-\ncations for driving, and the risk of inappropriate shocks. Furthermore,\npatients should be informed about the circumstances where the defib-\nrillator (or defibrillator component of a CRT-D) might be deactivated\n(e.g. terminal disease) or explanted (e.g. infection or recovery of LV\nfunction).193 Subsequent timely conversations regarding defibrillator\ndeactivation should be held with the patient and caregiver(s).\nWhen an ICD generator reaches its end of life or requires explan-\ntation, it should not be replaced automatically. Rather, shared deci-\nsion making should be undertaken.168\u0002172 Patients should be\ncarefully evaluated by an experienced cardiologist as treatment goals\nmay have changed since implantation (the risk of fatal arrhythmia\nmay be lower, or the risk of non-arrhythmic death may be higher).\nIt is a matter of some controversy whether patients whose\nLVEF has greatly improved and who have not required device ther-\napy during the lifetime of the ICD should have another device\nimplanted.168\u0002172\n6.1.4\nImplantable cardioverter-defibrillator\nprogramming\nRoutine defibrillation threshold testing is no longer performed fol-\nlowing implantation of an ICD or CRT-D as it does not improve\nshock efficacy or reduce arrhythmic death.194 Conservative program-\nming with long delays195 between detection and the ICD delivering\ntherapy dramatically reduces the risk of both inappropriate and\nappropriate but unnecessary shocks.194,196,197 Generally, for primary\nprevention, defibrillators are programmed to minimize pacing (e.g.\nventricular demand pacing VVI at 40/min), and with a tachycardia\ntreatment zone >200/min.194,198 Ultimately—and particularly for\nsecondary prevention—programming should be adapted according\nto the patient’s specific needs.\n6.1.5\nSubcutaneous and wearable implantable\ncardioverter-defibrillators\nSubcutaneous ICDs (S-ICDs) appear to be as effective as conven-\ntional transvenous ICDs with a similar complication rate. Although\nthe risk of inappropriate shocks appeared to be higher initially,\n3626\nESC Guidelines\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/36/3599/6358045 by guest on 14 January 2026",

An ICD is recom-\nmended in such patients when the intent is to increase survival; the\ndecision to implant should take into account the patient’s view and\ntheir QOL, the LVEF (survival benefit is uncertain when LVEF >35%)\nand the absence of other diseases likely to cause death within the fol-\nlowing year.162\u0002164,184\n6.1.2\nPrimary prevention of sudden cardiac death\nIn an analysis of over 40 000 patients from 12 pivotal HF trials, rates\nof sudden cardiac death decreased by 44% over the 20-year period\n(from the mid-1990s to 2015).160 This is almost certainly due to\nadvances in HF treatment, as many key guideline-recommended\ntherapies, including beta-blockers, MRAs, sacubitril/valsartan, and\nCRT pacemakers (CRT-P), reduce the risk of sudden death. While\nthe afore-mentioned HF therapies have been shown to reduce mor-\ntality in patients with HFrEF, amiodarone has not.161 However, if it is\nto be used, it should be with caution due to its significant side-effect\nprofile. Conversely, dronedarone185 and the class I antiarrhythmic\nagents disopyramide, encainide, and flecainide186 should not be used\nfor prevention of arrhythmias due to the increase in mortality seen in\nclinical studies.\nAlthough an ICD reduces the rate of sudden arrhythmic death in\npatients with HFrEF,187 it would be expected that, in well-managed\npatients, the additional benefit afforded by an ICD would be lower. In\nthe DANISH trial, rates of sudden death were low in patients with non-\nischaemic cardiomyopathy (NICM); only 70 patients out of 1116 fol-\nlowed up over 5 years had sudden death.166 Whilst there was a modest\nabsolute reduction in sudden death with a defibrillator-containing\ndevice, this did not significantly improve the overall risk of mortality.\nHowever, subgroup analysis suggested there was a benefit in those <_70\nyears.188 In a recent meta-analysis of studies that examined the effect of\nICDs in NICM a survival benefit was still seen, although the effect was\nsignificantly weakened by the inclusion of the DANISH trial.167\nOn average, patients with IHD are at greater risk of sudden death\nthan patients with NICM and therefore, although the relative benefits\nare similar, the absolute benefit is greater in patients with IHD.187 Two\nRCTs showed no benefit in patients who had an ICD implanted within\n40 days after a MI.177,178 Although sudden arrhythmic deaths were\nreduced, this was balanced by an increase in non-arrhythmic deaths.\nAccordingly, an ICD for primary prevention is contraindicated in this\ntime period. Furthermore, ICD implantation is recommended only if a\nminimum of 3 months of OMT has failed to increase the LVEF to\n>35%. OMT ideally includes the use of Class I recommended drugs for\nHFrEF. However, the ICD trials we cite predate the use of ARNI and\nSGLT2 inhibitors. Whether implantation of ICDs reduces mortality in\nthose with an LVEF >35% is unknown.

See the sec-\ntion on CRT for further details (section 6.2).\nIn patients with moderate or severe HF, a reduction in sudden\ndeath may be partially or wholly offset by an increase in death due to\nworsening HF.161 As such, ICD therapy is not recommended in\npatients in NYHA class IV, with severe symptoms refractory to phar-\nmacological therapy, who are not candidates for a ventricular assist\ndevice (VAD) or cardiac transplantation. Such patients have a very\nlimited life expectancy and are likely to die from pump failure.\nSimilarly, patients with serious comorbidities who are unlikely to sur-\nvive substantially more than 1 year with good QOL are unlikely to\nobtain substantial benefit from an ICD.179\u0002183\nAlthough the DANISH trial did not show a significant benefit from\nICD therapy in patients with NICM, it should be remembered that\nNICM is a heterogeneous condition, and certain subgroups (e.g. lami-\nnopathies, sarcoidosis) are at higher risk of sudden death and there-\nfore merit careful consideration of ICD implantation. Tools to help\nrisk stratification (e.g. scar burden on magnetic resonance imaging)\ncan be helpful in that regard.190\u0002192\nPatients should be counselled as to the purpose of an ICD and\ninvolved in the decision-making process. They should also be aware of\nthe potential complications related to implantation, any additional impli-\ncations for driving, and the risk of inappropriate shocks.

An ICD is recom-\nmended in such patients when the intent is to increase survival; the\ndecision to implant should take into account the patient’s view and\ntheir QOL, the LVEF (survival benefit is uncertain when LVEF >35%)\nand the absence of other diseases likely to cause death within the fol-\nlowing year.162\u0002164,184\n6.1.2\nPrimary prevention of sudden cardiac death\nIn an analysis of over 40 000 patients from 12 pivotal HF trials, rates\nof sudden cardiac death decreased by 44% over the 20-year period\n(from the mid-1990s to 2015).160 This is almost certainly due to\nadvances in HF treatment, as many key guideline-recommended\ntherapies, including beta-blockers, MRAs, sacubitril/valsartan, and\nCRT pacemakers (CRT-P), reduce the risk of sudden death. While\nthe afore-mentioned HF therapies have been shown to reduce mor-\ntality in patients with HFrEF, amiodarone has not.161 However, if it is\nto be used, it should be with caution due to its significant side-effect\nprofile. Conversely, dronedarone185 and the class I antiarrhythmic\nagents disopyramide, encainide, and flecainide186 should not be used\nfor prevention of arrhythmias due to the increase in mortality seen in\nclinical studies.\nAlthough an ICD reduces the rate of sudden arrhythmic death in\npatients with HFrEF,187 it would be expected that, in well-managed\npatients, the additional benefit afforded by an ICD would be lower. In\nthe DANISH trial, rates of sudden death were low in patients with non-\nischaemic cardiomyopathy (NICM); only 70 patients out of 1116 fol-\nlowed up over 5 years had sudden death.166 Whilst there was a modest\nabsolute reduction in sudden death with a defibrillator-containing\ndevice, this did not significantly improve the overall risk of mortality.\nHowever, subgroup analysis suggested there was a benefit in those <_70\nyears.188 In a recent meta-analysis of studies that examined the effect of\nICDs in NICM a survival benefit was still seen, although the effect was\nsignificantly weakened by the inclusion of the DANISH trial.167\nOn average, patients with IHD are at greater risk of sudden death\nthan patients with NICM and therefore, although the relative benefits\nare similar, the absolute benefit is greater in patients with IHD.187 Two\nRCTs showed no benefit in patients who had an ICD implanted within\n40 days after a MI.177,178 Although sudden arrhythmic deaths were\nreduced, this was balanced by an increase in non-arrhythmic deaths.\nAccordingly, an ICD for primary prevention is contraindicated in this\ntime period. Furthermore, ICD implantation is recommended only if a\nminimum of 3 months of OMT has failed to increase the LVEF to\n>35%. OMT ideally includes the use of Class I recommended drugs for\nHFrEF. However, the ICD trials we cite predate the use of ARNI and\nSGLT2 inhibitors. Whether implantation of ICDs reduces mortality in\nthose with an LVEF >35% is unknown. There is an ongoing trial of ICD\ntherapy in such patients with the presence of scar on CMR imaging.189\n6.1.3\nPatient selection for implantable cardioverter-\ndefibrillator therapy\nPatients with HFrEF and a QRS duration >_130 ms can be considered\nfor CRT with a defibrillator (CRT-D) rather than ICD.

Several\nstudies have indicated that CRT is superior to RV pacing in patients\nundergoing\natrio-ventricular\n(AV)\nnode\nablation.217,218,231\nHowever, AF is not an indication to carry out AV node ablation in\npatients with CRT except in a few cases when ventricular rate\nremains persistently high despite attempts at pharmacological rate\ncontrol. A subgroup analysis of patients with AF from the RAFT\nstudy found no benefit from CRT-D compared with ICD, although\nless than half of patients had >90% biventricular capture.219 In view\nof the paucity of evidence for the efficacy of CRT in patients with\nAF, it may be an option in selected patients—particularly those\nwith a QRS >_150 ms—ensuring a proportion of biventricular pac-\ning as high as possible.\nObservational studies report that when biventricular capture is\n<98%, the prognosis of patients with CRT declines.218,232 Whether\nthis association reflects a loss of resynchronization (which might be\nremedied by device programming), poor placement of the LV lead,\nor greater difficulty in pacing severely diseased myocardium is uncer-\ntain. This observation has not been confirmed in any randomized\ntrial.\nEarly studies suggested that imaging tests for dyssynchrony were\nnot of value in selecting patients for CRT.233 However, a recent study\nhas suggested that two novel markers of dyssynchrony (apical rock-\ning and septal flash) are associated with a response to CRT, but these\nhave not been tested as selection criteria or as prespecified sub-\ngroups in a randomized trial.234 Patients with extensive myocardial\nscar will have less improvement in LV function with CRT, but this is\ntrue of any treatment for HFrEF and does not reliably predict less\nclinical benefit. Pacing thresholds are higher in scarred myocardium\nand, if possible, lead placement should avoid such regions.235,236\nAlthough patients with extensive scarring have an intrinsically worse\nprognosis, there is little evidence that they obtain less prognostic\nbenefit from CRT.211\nThe value of trying to optimize AV intervals or interventricular\ndelay intervals (VV intervals) after implantation using echo- or elec-\ntrocardiographic criteria or BP response is uncertain but may be con-\nsidered for patients who have had a disappointing response to\nCRT.237,238 Other options to consider to optimize response to CRT\nare covered in a recently published practical article.239\nFollowing CRT implantation, a review of diuretic therapy is advised\nas a reduction in dose or its discontinuation may be required. In addi-\ntion, CRT implantation may afford an opportunity to further optimize\nMT for HFrEF.240\nThe reader is directed to guidelines on pacing and CRT for recom-\nmendations on device implantation procedures.240a\n6.3 Devices under evaluation\nCardiac contractility modulation (CCM) has been evaluated in\npatients with NYHA class III\u0002IV HF, with an LVEF >_25% to <_45%\nand QRS duration <130 ms, and was associated with a small improve-\nment in exercise tolerance and QOL.241,242\nTechnologies that involve modification of the activity of the auto-\nnomic nervous system, e.g. baroreflex activation therapy,243,244 have\nalso been shown to offer a modest improvement in effort capacity\nand QOL. However, currently, the evidence is considered insufficient\nto support specific guideline recommendations for a reduction in\nmortality or hospitalization for these and a variety of other implant-\nable electrical therapeutic technologies (see also Gaps in Evidence in\nsection 16).\n7 Heart failure with mildly\nreduced ejection fraction\n7.1 The diagnosis of heart failure with\nmildly reduced ejection fraction\nThe diagnosis of HFmrEF requires the presence of symptoms and/or\nsigns of HF, and a mildly reduced EF (41\u000249%) The presence of ele-\nvated NPs (BNP >_35 pg/mL or NT-proBNP >_125 pg/mL) and other\nevidence of structural heart disease [e.g. increased left atrial (LA) size,\nLVH or echocardiographic measures of LV filling] make the diagnosis\nmore likely but are not mandatory for diagnosis if there is certainty\nregarding the measurement of LVEF.\nAn algorithm for the diagnosis of HFmrEF is depicted in Figure 1.\nFor the investigation of the underlying aetiology, please refer to\nTable 5 (which refers to investigations regardless of LVEF).\n3628\nESC Guidelines\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/36/3599/6358045 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n............................................................................................................................................................................\n7.2 Clinical characteristics of patients\nwith heart failure with mildly reduced\nejection fraction\nThere is a substantial overlap of clinical characteristics, risk factors,\npatterns of cardiac remodelling, and outcomes among the LVEF cate-\ngories in HF.

Patients with HFmrEF have, on average, features that\nare more similar to HFrEF than HFpEF, in that they are more com-\nmonly\nmen,\nyounger,\nand\nare\nmore\nlikely\nto\nhave\nCAD\n(50\u000260%),38,42,43 and less likely to have AF and non-cardiac comor-\nbidities (Supplementary Table 10). However, ambulatory patients with\nHFmrEF have a lower mortality than those with HFrEF, more akin to\nthose with HFpEF.\nPatients with HFmrEF may include patients whose LVEF has\nimproved from <_40% or declined from >_50%.50\n7.3 Treatments for patients with heart\nfailure with mildly reduced ejection\nfraction\nAs in other forms of HF, diuretics should be used to control conges-\ntion. No substantial prospective RCT has been performed exclusively\nin patients with HFmrEF (Supplementary Table 11). Some data can be\ngleaned from subgroup analysis of trials in HFpEF, none of which\nhave met their primary endpoint. Although strong recommendations\ncannot be made about specific therapies at this point in time, we have\nincluded a Table of Recommendations to help guide the management\nof patients in this category.\n7.3.1\nAngiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors\nThere are no specific trials of ACE-I in patients with HFmrEF.\nAlthough, the PEP-CHF trial was conducted in patients with HFpEF\nand included patients with an LVEF >40%, it did not report outcomes\naccording to LVEF.11\nHowever, in patients with HFmrEF, many will also have CAD,\nhypertension, or post-MI LV systolic dysfunction and will, therefore,\nalready be treated with ACE-I.\nTherefore, ACE-I use may be considered in patients with HFmrEF.\n7.3.2\nAngiotensin receptor II type 1 receptor blockers\nThere are no specific trials of ARBs in HFmrEF. The CHARM-\nPreserved trial missed its primary endpoint of CV death or HF hospi-\ntalizations.245 However, a retrospective analysis showed that cande-\nsartan reduced the number of patients hospitalized for HF among\nthose with HFmrEF (with similar trends for CV and all-cause mortal-\nity).8 Moreover, a recurrent-event analysis suggested a reduction in\nhospitalizations for HF among the entire CHARM-Preserved cohort,\nincluding those with HFmrEF.248\nAs for ACE-I, many with HFmrEF will already be on an ARB for\nother CV indications. Therefore, treatment with ARBs may be con-\nsidered in patients with HFmrEF.\n7.3.3\nBeta-blockers\nThere is no specific trial of beta-blockade in HFmrEF. An IPD meta-\nanalysis of landmark trials of beta-blockers suggested similar reduc-\ntions in CV and all-cause mortality (of 50%) for patients in SR with\nHFrEF and HFmrEF.12 This IPD meta-analysis included the SENIORS\ntrial where nebivolol reduced the composite primary endpoint of all-\ncause mortality or CV hospital admissions in the overall population.\nNo interaction between LVEF (35% of patients had an LVEF of\n35\u000250%) and the effect of nebivolol on the primary outcome was\nobserved.119,249 Many patients with HFmrEF may have another CV\nindication, such as AF or angina, for a beta-blocker. Therefore, treat-\nment with beta-blockers may be considered in patients with HFmrEF.\n7.3.4\nMineralocorticoid receptor antagonists\nThere is no specific trial of MRAs in HFmrEF. In a retrospective analy-\nsis of the TOPCAT trial in patients with an LVEF >_45%,9 spironolac-\ntone reduced hospitalizations for HF in those with an LVEF <55%.\nThere was a similar trend for CV but not all-cause mortality.\nTreatment with an MRA may be considered in patients with\nHFmrEF.\n7.3.5\nAngiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor\nThere is no specific trial of ARNI in HFmrEF. In the PARAGON-HF\ntrial, which included patients with EF >_45%, although the trial missed\nits primary endpoint overall, a significant EF-by-treatment interaction\nwas observed. Sacubitril/valsartan, compared with valsartan, reduced\nthe likelihood of the primary composite outcome of CV death and\ntotal HF hospitalizations by 22% in those with an EF below or equal\nto the median of 57%.13 Further data are available from a combined\nanalysis of the PARADIGM-HF and PARAGON-HF trials showing\nthat sacubitril/valsartan, compared to other forms of RAAS blockade,\nhas a beneficial effect, especially on hospitalizations for HF in those\nwith HFmrEF.247\nPharmacological treatments to be considered in\npatients with (NYHA class II–IV) heart failure with\nmildly reduced ejection fraction\nRecommendations\nClassa\nLevelb\nDiuretics are recommended in patients with\ncongestion and HFmrEF in order to alleviate\nsymptoms and signs.137\nI\nC\nAn ACE-I may be considered for patients with\nHFmrEF to reduce the risk of HF hospitalization\nand death.11\nIIb\nC\nAn ARB may be considered for patients with\nHFmrEF to reduce the risk of HF hospitalization\nand death.245\nIIb\nC\nA beta-blocker may be considered for patients\nwith HFmrEF to reduce the risk of HF hospital-\nization and death.12,119\nIIb\nC\nAn MRA may be considered for patients with\nHFmrEF to reduce the risk of HF hospitalization\nand death.246\nIIb\nC\nSacubitril/valsartan may be considered for\npatients with HFmrEF to reduce the risk of HF\nhospitalization and death.13,247\nIIb\nC\nACE-I = angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor; ARB = angiotensin-receptor\nblocker; HF = heart failure; HFmrEF = heart failure with mildly reduced ejection\nfraction; MRA = mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist; NYHA = New York\nHeart Association.\naClass of recommendation.\nbLevel of evidence.\nESC 2021\nESC Guidelines\n3629\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/36/3599/6358045 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n.............................................................................................................................................................................\nTreatment with an ARNI may be considered in patients with\nHFmrEF.\n7.3.6\nOther drugs\nIn the DIG trial,10 for those with HFmrEF in SR, there was a trend to\nfewer hospitalizations for HF in those assigned to digoxin, but no\nreduction in mortality and a trend to an excess of CV deaths.\nTherefore, there are insufficient data to recommend its use.\nThere are also insufficient data on ivabradine in HFmrEF to draw\nany conclusions.\n7.3.7\nDevices\nWhile post hoc analyses of landmark CRT trials suggest that CRT\nmay benefit patients with LVEF >35%, trials of CRT for HFmrEF were\nabandoned due to poor recruitment.250 There are no substantial tri-\nals of ICDs for primary prevention of ventricular arrhythmias for\nHFmrEF; trials conducted more than 20 years ago suggested no bene-\nfit from ICD implantation for secondary prevention of ventricular\narrhythmias for HFmrEF.\nTherefore, there is insufficient evidence to advise CRT or ICD\ntherapy in patients with HFmrEF.\nIn HF patients with an LVEF >_40%, the implantation of an intera-\ntrial shunt device was found to be safe, and this device is subject to\ninvestigation in a larger study before any recommendation on their\nuse in HFpEF or HFmrEF can be given.251\n8 Heart failure with preserved\nejection fraction\n8.1 The background to heart failure with\npreserved ejection fraction\nThis guideline acknowledges the historical changes in nomenclature\nand the lack of consensus on the optimal LVEF cut-off to define the\ngroup of patients with HF without overtly reduced EF. The term ‘pre-\nserved’ was originally proposed in the Candesartan in Heart failure:\nAssessment of Reduction in Mortality and morbidity (CHARM)\nProgramme to refer to patients with an EF (>40%) that was not\nclearly ‘reduced’ or completely ‘normal’.252 While the current guide-\nlines have designated patients with an LVEF 41\u000249% as HFmrEF, we\nrecognize that there will be debate about what constitutes ‘mildly\nreduced’ EF, what these EF cut-offs should be, and whether they\nshould be different for men and women.14,253 The EACVI defines sys-\ntolic dysfunction as being <52% for males and <54% for females.16\nWhether patients with higher EFs and HF should be named HF\nwith ‘normal’ EF has also been considered.14,254 However, given the\nknown variability of echocardiographic measurements of LVEF, the\ndifficulties in interpreting LVEF measured using different imaging\nmodalities, and remaining controversies regarding the precise LVEF\ncut-off to define ‘normal’ , which may vary not only with sex but also\nwith other factors such as age and ethnicity,255 this guideline has kept\nthe nomenclature of HFpEF using an EF cut-off of 50%. Importantly,\nclinicians should be aware that LVEF is a continuous variable with a\nnormal distribution in the general population, and the EF cut-offs\nused in definitions are therefore arbitrary. Moreover, while the LVEF\ncut-off to define ‘normal’ will likely be higher than 50%, the presence\nof a very high EF (e.g. above 65\u000270%) should also prompt a search\nfor pathology, such as cardiac amyloidosis (CA) or hypertrophic car-\ndiomyopathy (HCM), where a ‘supra-normal’ EF may result from\nshrinkage of the LV end-diastolic volume (denominator of EF).256,257\n8.2 Clinical characteristics of patients\nwith heart failure with preserved ejection\nfraction\nHFpEF differs from HFrEF and HFmrEF in that HFpEF patients are\nolder and more often female. AF, CKD, and non-CV comorbidities\nare more common in patients with HFpEF than in those with\nHFrEF.258\nThere are numerous potential causes of HFpEF (Table 5). The\npathophysiology of various HFpEF syndromes differs, and thus they\nrequire distinct therapies. Red flags for the potential presence of CA\ninclude low normal BP in patients with a history of hypertension,\nintolerance to beta-blockers or ACE-I, history of bilateral carpal tun-\nnel syndrome, low voltage on ECG and echocardiographic features\nsuch as thickening of the septum, posterior wall, or RV wall, enlarged\natria, a small pericardial effusion, or valve thickening [for more details\nsee the section on CMP (section 14.2)]. Furthermore, it is important\nto exclude other conditions that might mimic the HFpEF syndrome\n(e.g. lung disease, anaemia, obesity, and deconditioning). For a more\ncomprehensive overview on HFpEF, see the ESC/HFA position\nstatement.259\n8.3 The diagnosis of heart failure with\npreserved ejection fraction\nThe diagnosis of HFpEF remains challenging. Several diagnostic criteria\nhave been proposed by societies and in clinical trials.260 These criteria\nvary widely in their sensitivities and specificities for diagnosing HFpEF.\nMore recently, two score-based algorithms (H2FPEF and HFA-PEFF)\nhave been proposed to aid the diagnosis.259,261 While the generaliz-\nability of the scores has been tested in various trial and observational\ncohorts, their diagnostic performance has varied.262\u0002269\nBoth scores assign a substantial proportion of suspected HFpEF\npatients as intermediate likelihood, wherein additional diagnostics are\nproposed. Thus, depending on which score is used, different patients\nwill be referred for additional testing or allocated as having HFpEF.\nFurthermore, physicians may not have access to all the specialized\ntests recommended by the specific diagnostic algorithms. This limits\nthe broad clinical applicability of the scores and demonstrates the\nongoing diagnostic uncertainty in HFpEF.267\nTo facilitate broad clinical application, this guideline recom-\nmends a simplified pragmatic approach that distils the common\nmajor elements in prior diagnostic criteria and emphasizes the\nmost frequently used variables widely available to clinicians. Some\nof these variables, in particular, LA size (LA volume index\n>32 mL/m2), mitral E velocity >90 cm/s, septal e0 velocity <9 cm/s,\nE/e0 ratio >9 have been shown to be pivot points beyond which\nthe risk of CV mortality is increased, underscoring their value.270\nThis recommendation is therefore consistent with the consensus\ndocument of the HFA, and does not represent a new algorithm\nor diagnostic score but rather a simplified approach.

The diagnosis\nshould include the following:\n(1)\nSymptoms and signs of HF.\n(2)\nAn LVEF >_50%.*\n(3)\nObjective evidence of cardiac structural and/or functional abnor-\nmalities consistent with the presence of LV diastolic dysfunction/\nraised LV filling pressures, including raised NPs (Table 9).\n*Of note, patients with a history of overtly reduced LVEF (<_40%),\nwho later present with LVEF >_50%, should be considered to have\nrecovered HFrEF or ‘HF with improved LVEF’ (rather than HFpEF).\nContinued treatment for HFrEF is recommended in these patients.271\nIt is not known whether starting HF therapy in patients with recov-\nered LVEF is beneficial. Patients with HFpEF tend to have stable tra-\njectory of LVEF over time.272 However, in those who develop a\nclinical indication for a repeat echo during follow-up, around one\nthird have a decline in LVEF.273\nIn the presence of AF, the threshold for LA volume index is >40\nmL/m2. Exercise stress thresholds include E/e0 ratio at peak stress >_15\nor tricuspid regurgitation (TR) velocity at peak stress >3.4 m/s.275 LV\nglobal longitudinal strain <16% has a sensitivity of 62% and a specificity\nof 56% for the diagnosis of HFpEF by invasive testing.261\nThe approach to the diagnosis should involve additional confirma-\ntory tests in cases of diagnostic uncertainty, such as cardiopulmonary\nexercise testing (to confirm a reduction in exercise capacity and to\nhelp differentiate the cause of dyspnoea), exercise stress testing, and\ninvasive haemodynamic testing.259\nIf resting echocardiographic and laboratory markers are equivocal,\na diastolic stress test is recommended.259,274 The confirmatory test\nfor the diagnosis of HFpEF is invasive haemodynamic exercise testing.\nAn invasively measured pulmonary capillary wedge pressure\n(PCWP) of >_15 mmHg (at rest) or >_25 mmHg (with exercise) or LV\nend-diastolic pressure >_16 mmHg (at rest) is generally considered\ndiagnostic.266 However, instead of an exercise PCWP cut-off, some\nhave used an index of PCWP to cardiac output for the invasive diag-\nnosis of HFpEF260,276.

      "content": ".....................................................................................................\nThis simplified diagnostic approach starts with assessment of pre-\ntest probability (see clinical characteristics above). The diagnosis\nshould include the following:\n(1)\nSymptoms and signs of HF.\n(2)\nAn LVEF >_50%.*\n(3)\nObjective evidence of cardiac structural and/or functional abnor-\nmalities consistent with the presence of LV diastolic dysfunction/\nraised LV filling pressures, including raised NPs (Table 9).\n*Of note, patients with a history of overtly reduced LVEF (<_40%),\nwho later present with LVEF >_50%, should be considered to have\nrecovered HFrEF or ‘HF with improved LVEF’ (rather than HFpEF).\nContinued treatment for HFrEF is recommended in these patients.271\nIt is not known whether starting HF therapy in patients with recov-\nered LVEF is beneficial. Patients with HFpEF tend to have stable tra-\njectory of LVEF over time.272 However, in those who develop a\nclinical indication for a repeat echo during follow-up, around one\nthird have a decline in LVEF.273\nIn the presence of AF, the threshold for LA volume index is >40\nmL/m2. Exercise stress thresholds include E/e0 ratio at peak stress >_15\nor tricuspid regurgitation (TR) velocity at peak stress >3.4 m/s.275 LV\nglobal longitudinal strain <16% has a sensitivity of 62% and a specificity\nof 56% for the diagnosis of HFpEF by invasive testing.261\nThe approach to the diagnosis should involve additional confirma-\ntory tests in cases of diagnostic uncertainty, such as cardiopulmonary\nexercise testing (to confirm a reduction in exercise capacity and to\nhelp differentiate the cause of dyspnoea), exercise stress testing, and\ninvasive haemodynamic testing.259\nIf resting echocardiographic and laboratory markers are equivocal,\na diastolic stress test is recommended.259,274 The confirmatory test\nfor the diagnosis of HFpEF is invasive haemodynamic exercise testing.\nAn invasively measured pulmonary capillary wedge pressure\n(PCWP) of >_15 mmHg (at rest) or >_25 mmHg (with exercise) or LV\nend-diastolic pressure >_16 mmHg (at rest) is generally considered\ndiagnostic.266 However, instead of an exercise PCWP cut-off, some\nhave used an index of PCWP to cardiac output for the invasive diag-\nnosis of HFpEF260,276. Recognizing that invasive haemodynamic exer-\ncise testing is not available in many centres worldwide, and is\nassociated with risks, its main use is limited to the research setting. In\nthe absence of any disease-modifying treatments, the current guide-\nlines do not mandate gold standard testing in every patient to make\nthe diagnosis, but emphasize that the greater the number of objective\nnon-invasive markers of raised LV filling pressures (Table 9), the\nhigher the probability of a diagnosis of HFpEF.\n8.4 Treatment of heart failure with\npreserved ejection fraction\nTo date, no treatment has been shown to convincingly reduce\nmortality and morbidity in patients with HFpEF, although improve-\nments have been seen for some specific phenotypes of patients\nwithin the overall HFpEF umbrella. However, none of the large\nRCTs conducted in HFpEF have achieved their primary endpoints.\nThese include PEP-CHF (perindopril),277 CHARM-Preserved (can-\ndesartan),245 I-PRESERVE (irbesartan),278 TOPCAT (spironolac-\ntone),246\nDIG-Preserved\n(digoxin),279\nand\nPARAGON-HF\n(sacubitril/valsartan)13 (see Supplementary Table 12 for the details\nabout these and additional trials).

For sacubitril/valsartan, this decision\nwas based on the subgroup analysis from the PARAGON-HF study,\nwhich showed a reduction in HF hospitalizations in those with an\nLVEF <57%, and a meta-analysis of the PARADIGM-HF and\nPARAGON-HF studies, showing a reduction in CV death and HF\nhospitalization in those with an LVEF below the normal range.247\nRegarding spironolactone, the subgroup of individuals in the\nTOPCAT study recruited in the Americas had a significant reduc-\ntion in the primary endpoint of CV death and HF hospitalization,\nand a subsequent post hoc analysis by EF showed a significant\nreduction in outcomes for those with an LVEF <55%.9,247 There are\nalso ongoing trials with SGLT2 inhibitors. These developments may\nwell accelerate a redefinition of HFpEF in the future and have thera-\npeutic implications.\nIn the absence of recommendations regarding disease-modifying\ntherapies, treatment should be aimed at reducing symptoms of con-\ngestion with diuretics.

For sacubitril/valsartan, this decision\nwas based on the subgroup analysis from the PARAGON-HF study,\nwhich showed a reduction in HF hospitalizations in those with an\nLVEF <57%, and a meta-analysis of the PARADIGM-HF and\nPARAGON-HF studies, showing a reduction in CV death and HF\nhospitalization in those with an LVEF below the normal range.247\nRegarding spironolactone, the subgroup of individuals in the\nTOPCAT study recruited in the Americas had a significant reduc-\ntion in the primary endpoint of CV death and HF hospitalization,\nand a subsequent post hoc analysis by EF showed a significant\nreduction in outcomes for those with an LVEF <55%.9,247 There are\nalso ongoing trials with SGLT2 inhibitors. These developments may\nwell accelerate a redefinition of HFpEF in the future and have thera-\npeutic implications.\nIn the absence of recommendations regarding disease-modifying\ntherapies, treatment should be aimed at reducing symptoms of con-\ngestion with diuretics. Loop diuretics are preferred, although thiazide\ndiuretics may be useful for managing hypertension. Reducing body\nweight in obese patients and increasing exercise may further improve\nsymptoms and exercise capacity and should therefore be considered\nin appropriate patients.284,285\nIt is important to identify and treat the underlying risk factors, aeti-\nology, and coexisting comorbidities in HFpEF (e.g. hypertension in\nsection 12.4, CAD in section 12.2, amyloidosis in section 14.6, AF in\nsection 12.1.1,\nand\nvalvular\nheart\ndisease\nin\nsection 12.3).\nUndoubtably, treatment of some of the underlying phenotypes of the\nthe HFpEF syndrome leads to improved outcomes.\nRecommendations for the treatment of patients with\nheart failure with preserved ejection fraction\nRecommendations\nClassa\nLevelb\nScreening for, and treatment of, aetiologies, and\ncardiovascular and non-cardiovascular comor-\nbidities is recommended in patients with HFpEF\n(see relevant sections of this document).\nI\nC\nDiuretics are recommended in congested\npatients with HFpEF in order to alleviate symp-\ntoms and signs.137\nI\nC\nHFpEF = heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.\naClass of recommendation.\nbLevel of evidence.\nESC 2021\nESC 2021\nTable 10\nRisk factors for the development of heart\nfailure and potential corrective actions\nRisk factors for heart\nfailure\nPreventive strategies\nSedentary habit\nRegular physical activity\nCigarette smoking\nCigarette smoking cessation\nObesity\nPhysical activity and healthy diet\nExcessive alcohol intake286\nGeneral population: no/light alcohol\nintake is beneﬁcial\nPatients with alcohol-induced CMP\nshould abstain from alcohol\nInﬂuenza\nInﬂuenza vaccination\nMicrobes (e.g. Trypanosoma\ncruzi, Streptococci)\nEarly diagnosis, speciﬁc antimicrobial\ntherapy for either prevention and/or\ntreatment\nCardiotoxic drugs (e.g.,\nanthracyclines)\nCardiac function and side effect moni-\ntoring, dose adaptation, change of\nchemotherapy\nChest radiation\nCardiac function and side effect moni-\ntoring, dose adaptation\nHypertension\nLifestyle changes, antihypertensive\ntherapy\nDyslipidaemia\nHealthy diet, statins\nDiabetes mellitus\nPhysical activity and healthy diet,\nSGLT2 inhibitors\nCAD\nLifestyle changes, statin therapy\nCAD = coronary artery disease; CMP = cardiomyopathy; SGLT2 = sodium-glu-\ncose co-transporter 2.\nESC 2021\nRecommendations for the primary prevention of heart\nfailure in patients with risk factors for its development\nRecommendations\nClassa\nLevelb\nTreatment of hypertension is recommended to\nprevent or delay the onset of HF, and to prevent\nHF hospitalizations.287\u0002290\nI\nA\nTreatment with statins is recommended in\npatients at high risk of CV disease or with CV\ndisease in order to prevent or delay the onset of\nHF, and to prevent HF hospitalizations.291,292\nI\nA\nSGLT2 inhibitors (canagliﬂozin, dapagliﬂozin,\nempagliﬂozin, ertugliﬂozin, sotagliﬂozin) are rec-\nommended in patients with diabetes at high risk\nof CV disease or with CV disease in order to\nprevent HF hospitalizations.293\u0002297\nI\nA\nCounselling against sedentary habit, obesity, ciga-\nrette smoking, and alcohol abuse is recom-\nmended to prevent or delay the onset of\nHF.298\u0002302\nI\nC\nCV=cardiovascular; HF= heart failure; SGLT2= sodium-glucose co-transporter 2.\naClass of recommendation.\nbLevel of evidence.\n............................................................................................................................................................................\n3632\nESC Guidelines\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/36/3599/6358045 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n.......................................................\n9 Multidisciplinary team\nmanagement for the prevention\nand treatment of chronic heart\nfailure\n9.1 Prevention of heart failure\nGeneral advice about risk factors for the development of HF (see\nSupplementary Figure 1) and strategies to prevent HF early in the CV\ncontinuum are summarized in Table 10.\nIt is widely recognized that, in addition to optimizing medical and\ndevice therapies for HF, attention should also be given to how HF\ncare is delivered.

The HFA of the ESC has issued several position\npapers that cover non-pharmacological management, discharge plan-\nning, and standards for delivering HF care.303\u0002305 It has also under-\nscored the need for specialist HF cardiologists and specialist HF\nnurses to help provide care. Detailed curricula, to aid training of\nthese, are available to be adapted for national implementation.306,307\nThis section focuses on areas where recommendations with an evi-\ndence level can be given: multidisciplinary team management, lifestyle\nadvice, exercise training, follow-up, and monitoring.\n9.2 Multidisciplinary management of\nchronic heart failure\n9.2.1 Models of care\nIn order to reduce hospitalizations and mortality, earlier guidelines1\nrecommended\nthe\nuse\nof\nmultidisciplinary\nHF\nmanagement\nprogrammes (HF-MPs), which enable patients to have the correct\ninvestigations, an accurate diagnosis, appropriate evidence-based\ntherapy, education, and suitable follow-up. The optimal implementa-\ntion of a HF-MP requires a multidisciplinary team that is active along\nthe whole HF trajectory; from onset, through critical events, periods\nof apparent stability, and its terminal stages.303 Since the 2016 guide-\nlines, new studies have been published that underscore the need for\nHF-MPs and reveal more insights into how care can be delivered.\nA network meta-analysis including 53 randomized trials published\nin 2017, concluded that both disease-management clinics and home\nvisits by nurses reduced all-cause mortality compared to usual care;\nhome visits being most effective.308 An IPD meta-analysis of 20 stud-\nies, including 5624 patients, concluded that self-management interven-\ntions in HF patients improve outcomes despite heterogeneity in the\nintensity, content, and the personnel who deliver the interventions.309\nHF-MPs vary in their components and can apply different service\nmodels, such as clinic-based approaches (in primary, secondary, or\ntertiary care), home-based programmes, case management, or\nhybrids of these. Components used in the services vary, e.g. some\nHF-MPs use telemonitoring that may be applied at a local, regional,\nor national level. No service model has been shown to be consis-\ntently superior to others.310 While home visits and HF clinics do\nreduce all-cause admissions and mortality, educational programmes,\nused alone, do not.308,309 HF-MPs should be patient-centred and take\na holistic approach to the patient rather than focussing solely on HF;\nmanagement of comorbid conditions, such as arrhythmias, hyperten-\nsion, diabetes, renal dysfunction, and depression, improve patient\nwell-being and self-management, leading to better outcomes.309,311\nThe organization of a HF-MP should be adapted to the healthcare\nsystem, available resources (infrastructure, facilities, staff, and finan-\nces), administrative policies, and tailored to the patient’s needs.\nMany patients with HF would derive benefit from the early integra-\ntion of a palliative and supportive approach within the care provided\nby all members of the HF multidisciplinary team.312,313 Palliative and\nsupportive care should be thought about for all patients with HF,\nregardless of stage of their illness. Patients in the advanced stages and\nthose considered for mechanical circulatory support (MCS) or heart\ntransplantation should receive a palliative care consultation before\nsuch interventions as a matter of protocol (see section 10.2.4).\n9.2.2 Characteristics and components of a heart failure\nmanagement programme\nClinical trials have included complex, bundled interventions, making\nit difficult to determine the efficiency and effectiveness of each spe-\ncific component. Table 11 presents an overview of characteristics and\ncomponents that are important to consider in a HF-MP.\n9.3 Patient education, self-care and\nlifestyle advice\nAdequate patient self-care is essential in the effective management of\nHF and allows patients to understand what is beneficial, and to agree\nto self-monitoring and management plans.319 HF patients who report\nmore effective self-care have a better QOL, lower readmission rates,\nand reduced mortality.309\nMisunderstandings, misconceptions, and lack of knowledge all con-\ntribute to insufficient self-care and therefore patient education is vital.\nImproving patients’ knowledge of their condition is fundamental for\nthe development of self-care skills.304\nEducation to improve self-care should be tailored to the individual\npatient and based on, where available, scientific evidence or expert\nopinion. There is little evidence that specific lifestyle advice improves\nMultidisciplinary interventions recommended for the\nmanagement of chronic heart failure\nRecommendations\nClassa\nLevelb\nIt is recommended that HF patients are enrolled\nin a multidisciplinary HF management pro-\ngramme to reduce the risk of HF hospitalization\nand mortality.309,314,315,316\nI\nA\nSelf-management strategies are recommended\nto reduce the risk of HF hospitalization and\nmortality.309\nI\nA\nEither home-based and/or clinic-based pro-\ngrammes improve outcomes and are recom-\nmended to reduce the risk of HF hospitalization\nand mortality.310,317\nI\nA\nInﬂuenza and pneumococcal vaccinations should\nbe considered in order to prevent HF\nhospitalizations.315,316\nIIa\nB\nHF = heart failure.\naClass of recommendation.\nbLevel of evidence.\nESC 2021\n......................................................................................................................\nESC Guidelines\n3633\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/36/3599/6358045 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\nTable 11\nImportant characteristics and components in a heart failure management programme\nCharacteristics\n1.\nPatient/person-centred318\n2.\nMultidisciplinary\n3.\nThe focus of the programme should be ﬂexible and include:\n• prevention of disease progression\n• symptom control\n• maintaining patients in their preferred place of care for end-stage heart failure\n4.\nCompetent and professionally educated staff\n5.\nEncourage patient/carer engagement in the understanding and management of their condition\nComponents\n1.\nOptimized management;

Offer help and guidance to use\nit and offer discussion of questions arising.\n• Inviting patients to be accompanied by a family member or friend.\nKey topics to include are recommended in Table 12.\n9.4 Exercise rehabilitation\nThere is consistent evidence that physical conditioning by exercise\ntraining improves exercise tolerance, and health-related QOL in\npatients with HF. Clinical trials and meta-analyses in people with\nHFrEF show that exercise rehabilitation improves exercise capacity\nand QOL. Several meta-analyses also show that it reduces all-cause\nand HF hospitalizations, although uncertainty persists about its effects\non mortality.322\u0002328 The effect on hospitalization is seen in those\nwho are highly adherent to the exercise programme.329 High-\nintensity interval training, in patients who are able and willing,\nmay improve peak oxygen consumption (VO2).330,331 Supervised\nexercise-based rehabilitation should be considered in those who are\nfrail, who have more severe disease or comorbidities.95\nPhysical\nconditioning\nalso\nimproves\nexercise\ncapacity\nand\nQOL.332\u0002335 No data on HFmrEF are available, but benefits\nobserved in the other groups of HF should also apply to this group.\n9.5 Follow-up of chronic heart failure\n9.5.1 General follow-up\nThis is a relatively understudied area. Patients with HF, even if symp-\ntoms are well controlled and stable, require follow-up to ensure con-\ntinued optimization of therapy, to detect asymptomatic progression of\nHF or its comorbidities and to discuss any new advances in care. These\nguidelines recommend follow-up at intervals no longer than 6 months\nto check symptoms, heart rate and rhythm, BP, full blood count, elec-\ntrolytes, and renal function. For patients recently discharged from hos-\npital, or in those undergoing uptitration of medication, follow-up\nintervals should be more frequent. Whether such stable patients need\nto be followed-up by cardiologists is uncertain. Some studies suggest\nthat follow-up in primary care may be appropriate.303,339 However,\nuptake of evidence-based interventions is poor in many settings340,104\nand several studies suggest that care and follow-up provided by HF\nspecialists, and use of quality improvement registries can lead to higher\nrates of optimal therapy and improved outcomes.341\u0002343\nAn ECG should be done annually to detect QRS prolongation344\nas such patients may become candidates for CRT. Furthermore, it\nmay identify conduction disturbances and AF.\nSerial echocardiography is generally not necessary, although an\nechocardiogram should be repeated if there has been a deterioration\nin clinical status. An echocardiogram is also advised 3\u00026 months after\noptimization of standard therapies for HFrEF to determine the need\nfor addition of newer pharmacological agents and implanted devices.\n9.5.2 Monitoring with biomarkers\nTrials investigating the use of biomarkers (particularly BNP and/or\nNT-proBNP) to guide pharmacotherapy for HFrEF have produced\nconflicting results.345\u0002352 They are undoubtedly good prognostic\nmarkers.72,353,354 Conceptually, it is not clear what a biomarker-\nsupported strategy might offer in addition to assiduous application of\nguideline-recommended therapy. Current evidence, therefore, does\nnot support the routine measurement of BNP or NT-proBNP to\nguide titration of therapy.\n9.6 Telemonitoring\nTelemonitoring enables patients to provide, remotely, digital health\ninformation to support and optimize their care. Data such as\nTable 12\nContinued\nEducation topic\nGoal for the patient and caregiver\nProfessional behaviour and educational tools\nTo recognise that the carer or family members may be\ngreatly affected and need to seek help.\nFamily and informal\ncaregivers\nTo be able to ask for support.\nDiscuss the preference of caregiver/family involvement.\nInvolve patients and caregivers in a respectful way.\nCMP = cardiomyopathy; CV = cardiovascular; HF = heart failure.\na1 unit is 10 mL of pure alcohol (e.g., 1 glass of wine, 1=2 pint of beer, 1 measure of spirit).\nRecommendations for exercise rehabilitation in patients\nwith chronic heart failure\nRecommendations\nClassa\nLevelb\nExercise is recommended for all patients who are\nable in order to improve exercise capacity, QOL,\nand reduce HF hospitalization.c 324\u0002328,335\u0002337\nI\nA\nA supervised, exercise-based, cardiac rehabilita-\ntion programme should be considered in\npatients with more severe disease, frailty, or\nwith comorbidities.95,324\u0002327,338\nIIa\nC\nHF = heart failure; QOL = quality of life.\naClass of recommendation.\nbLevel of evidence.\ncIn those who are able to adhere to the exercise programme.\nESC 2021\nESC 2021\n3636\nESC Guidelines\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/36/3599/6358045 by guest on 14 January 2026",

Reinforce\nmessages at regular time intervals.\n• Recognizing barriers to communication (language, social skills,\ncognition, anxiety/depression, hearing or visual challenges).\n• Recommending ‘HFmatters.org’. Offer help and guidance to use\nit and offer discussion of questions arising.\n• Inviting patients to be accompanied by a family member or friend.\nKey topics to include are recommended in Table 12.\n9.4 Exercise rehabilitation\nThere is consistent evidence that physical conditioning by exercise\ntraining improves exercise tolerance, and health-related QOL in\npatients with HF. Clinical trials and meta-analyses in people with\nHFrEF show that exercise rehabilitation improves exercise capacity\nand QOL. Several meta-analyses also show that it reduces all-cause\nand HF hospitalizations, although uncertainty persists about its effects\non mortality.322\u0002328 The effect on hospitalization is seen in those\nwho are highly adherent to the exercise programme.329 High-\nintensity interval training, in patients who are able and willing,\nmay improve peak oxygen consumption (VO2).330,331 Supervised\nexercise-based rehabilitation should be considered in those who are\nfrail, who have more severe disease or comorbidities.95\nPhysical\nconditioning\nalso\nimproves\nexercise\ncapacity\nand\nQOL.332\u0002335 No data on HFmrEF are available, but benefits\nobserved in the other groups of HF should also apply to this group.\n9.5 Follow-up of chronic heart failure\n9.5.1 General follow-up\nThis is a relatively understudied area. Patients with HF, even if symp-\ntoms are well controlled and stable, require follow-up to ensure con-\ntinued optimization of therapy, to detect asymptomatic progression of\nHF or its comorbidities and to discuss any new advances in care. These\nguidelines recommend follow-up at intervals no longer than 6 months\nto check symptoms, heart rate and rhythm, BP, full blood count, elec-\ntrolytes, and renal function. For patients recently discharged from hos-\npital, or in those undergoing uptitration of medication, follow-up\nintervals should be more frequent. Whether such stable patients need\nto be followed-up by cardiologists is uncertain. Some studies suggest\nthat follow-up in primary care may be appropriate.303,339 However,\nuptake of evidence-based interventions is poor in many settings340,104\nand several studies suggest that care and follow-up provided by HF\nspecialists, and use of quality improvement registries can lead to higher\nrates of optimal therapy and improved outcomes.341\u0002343\nAn ECG should be done annually to detect QRS prolongation344\nas such patients may become candidates for CRT. Furthermore, it\nmay identify conduction disturbances and AF.\nSerial echocardiography is generally not necessary, although an\nechocardiogram should be repeated if there has been a deterioration\nin clinical status. An echocardiogram is also advised 3\u00026 months after\noptimization of standard therapies for HFrEF to determine the need\nfor addition of newer pharmacological agents and implanted devices.\n9.5.2 Monitoring with biomarkers\nTrials investigating the use of biomarkers (particularly BNP and/or\nNT-proBNP) to guide pharmacotherapy for HFrEF have produced\nconflicting results.345\u0002352 They are undoubtedly good prognostic\nmarkers.72,353,354 Conceptually, it is not clear what a biomarker-\nsupported strategy might offer in addition to assiduous application of\nguideline-recommended therapy. Current evidence, therefore, does\nnot support the routine measurement of BNP or NT-proBNP to\nguide titration of therapy.\n9.6 Telemonitoring\nTelemonitoring enables patients to provide, remotely, digital health\ninformation to support and optimize their care.

Identifying warning signs in patients\nwith non-advanced symptoms may allow early referral so that MCS\nand heart transplantation may be offered before the development of\nend-organ failure (Figure 5; Supplementary Table 14).376,386 An organi-\nzational model between centres with different levels of care com-\nplexity, based on a ‘Hub and Spoke’ network is the key to good\npatient management.376\n10.2 Management\nIn patients with advanced HF, pharmacological therapy and short-\nterm MCS may be needed until the implantation of long-term MCS\nor heart transplantation becomes available.\n10.2.1\nPharmacological therapy and renal replacement\nInotropes may improve haemodynamic parameters, reducing con-\ngestion, augmenting cardiac output, and aiding peripheral perfusion.\nAlthough not proven, this may help to prevent worsening end-organ\nfunction. Conversely, traditional inotropes may favor myocardial\nischaemia\nand/or\ntachyarrhythmias\nand\nworsen\nthe\nclinical\ncourse.387,388 They can be used as palliative therapy for the relief of\nsymptoms in patients without other treatment options. Intermittent\nlong-term use of inotropes may be considered in outpatients to\nimprove functional class and QOL.389,390\nKidney dysfunction and loop diuretic resistance often characterize\nthe clinical course of patients with advanced HF. Doubling of the\nloop diuretic dose is proposed, in the first instance, followed by con-\ncomitant administration of thiazides or metolazone (see section\n11.3.3).145 In patients who fail to respond to diuretic-based strategies,\nrenal replacement therapies should be considered.

Indications for short- and long-term MCS\nshould be based on the INTERMACS profiles (Table 14, Figure 4).\nShort-term mechanical circulatory support\nShort-term MCS devices are indicated to reverse critical end-\norgan hypoperfusion and hypoxia in the setting of cardiogenic\nshock. They can be used for a short, limited, period of time, from a\nfew days up to several weeks. The aim is to support the central\nnervous system and organ perfusion, to reverse acidosis and\nmulti-organ failure until the patient’s outcome becomes clearer\nbe that of cardiac recovery, transition to durable MCS or heart\ntransplantation, or, in some cases, towards a more palliative\napproach. The care of patients on short-term MCS is complex and\nrequires dedicated expertise including having specific plans for\nstopping support when neither cardiac nor brain injury recovers.\nShort-term MCS should be used in patients with INTERMACS\nprofiles 1 or 2 as a bridge to decision (BTD), bridge to recovery\n(BTR), bridge to bridge (BTB) for either long-term MCS or urgent\nheart transplantation (Figure 4).394 Further details about short-\nterm MCS are reported in the Supplementary text 11.4.\nLong-term mechanical circulatory support\nLong-term MCS is indicated in selected patients when MT is insuffi-\ncient or when short-term MCS has not led to cardiac recovery or\nclinical improvement, to prolong life and improve QOL, or to keep\nthe patient alive until transplantation (bridge to transplantation, BTT)\nor to reverse contraindications to heart transplantation (bridge to\ncandidacy, BTC), or as destination therapy (DT) (Table 15).\nLong-term\nMCS\nshould\nbe\nconsidered\nin\npatients\nwith\nINTERMACS profiles 2 to 4 and also in patients with INTERMACS\nTable 14\nContinued\nProfile\nTime frame for intervention\nProﬁle 7.

Patients with\nno irreversible end-organ failure other than cardiac, recovering from\nINTERMACS level 1 while on short-term MCS, may also qualify for\nlong-term MCS (Figure 4).376,378,383,395\u0002402 The characteristics of\npatients potentially eligible for implantation of an LVAD are reported\nin Table 16.\nThe details of the devices and studies on long-term MCS are sum-\nmarized in Supplementary Table 15.\nCurrent 2-year survival rates in patients receiving the latest\ncontinuous-flow LVADs are comparable to those after heart\ntransplantation, although adverse events negatively affect QOL.\nAmong patients with continuous flow LVADs, actuarial survival was\nreported of 80% at 1 year and 70% at 2 years.403,404 Two-year sur-\nvival was 84.5% and survival free of disabling stroke or need of reop-\neration for LVAD malfunction was 76.9% with a centrifugal-flow\nLVAD in MOMENTUM 3.405 The fully magnetically levitated\ncentrifugal-flow LVAD has significantly reduced pump thrombosis. In\nMOMENTUM 3, the need for reoperation to replace a malfunction-\ning device was 2.3% per 24 months, with only 0.6% per 24 months\nrisk of pump replacement because of pump thrombosis. Stroke\n(namely, disabling stroke), major bleeding, and gastrointestinal hae-\nmorrhage were also lower in the centrifugal-flow pump group than in\nthe axial-flow pump group. However, the incidence of all bleeding\nevents, thromboembolism and driveline infection remained similar to\nthat with older devices.402\nData on fully magnetically centrifugal-flow LVAD use in real-world\nstudies with the 2-year outcomes from the ELEVATE registry\nshowed an overall survival of 74.5%, with gastrointestinal bleeding in\n9.7%, stroke in 10.2%, and pump thrombosis in 1.5% of patients.406\nAccording to the IMACS Registry, a new composite endpoint includ-\ning QOL and adverse events beyond survival was proposed to help\nin guiding decision making. In this sense ‘living well at one year’\ndefined as freedom from death, stroke, bleeding requiring operation,\nRV assist device, pump replacement, or device-related infection\nwithin the first year, was 56.8% after isolated, centrifugal flow-\nLVAD.383\nAlthough\nnow\noutdated,\nREMATCH\nwas\nthe\nonly\nRCT\ncomparing an LVAD as DT with OMT in patients with advanced HF,\nNYHA class IV and a contraindication to transplantation.

Also, the Swedish evaluation of LVAD (SweVAD)\nstudy is comparing the survival of patients with advanced HF ineligible\nfor heart transplantation prospectively randomized to LVAD as DT\nvs. MT (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02592499).410\n10.2.3\nHeart transplantation\nHeart transplantation remains the gold standard for the treatment of\nadvanced HF in the absence of contraindications. Post-transplant 1-\nyear survival is around 90% with a median survival of 12.5\nyears.385,411,412 Transplantation significantly improves QOL and func-\ntional status, although, for unclear reasons, the percentage of patients\nreturning to work is lower than expected.412 Apart from primary\ngraft dysfunction, the main challenges after heart transplantation\nrelate to either the efficacy or side effects of immunosuppression\n(e.g. rejection, infection, cardiac allograft vasculopathy, late graft dys-\nfunction, malignancy, renal failure, hypertension, diabetes mellitus).\nOrgan donor shortage remains the main limitation to heart trans-\nplantation. Thus, the donor heart criteria have now been extended\nto allow an increased upper limit of the donor age, particularly in\nEurope. Moreover, careful recipient selection is needed, based on\npre-transplant and post-transplant life expectancy (both are influ-\nenced by pre-operative status and comorbidities).\nThe main indications and contraindications for heart transplanta-\ntion are listed in Table 17.376,385\nActive infection is a relative contraindication to transplant but in\nsome cases of infected LVADs it may actually be an indication. Elderly\nage is not an absolute contraindication. Although patients aged <65\nyears might be more appropriate candidates due to their overall life\nexpectancy, most programmes accept patients up to 70 years of age,\nand biological age as well as chronological age must be taken into\naccount. Surgical complexity [previous sternotomies, mediastinal\nradiation, adult congenital heart disease (ACHD)] should also be\nconsidered.\nThe decision pathway to transplantation or LVAD is never\nstraightforward and is unique to each patient.

In\naddition to clinical assessment, symptoms can be assessed using\nthe Numeric Rating Scale, the Edmonton Symptom Assessment\nScale (ESAS) or ESAS-HF, or the Integrated Palliative care Outcome\nScale.\nTreatment for symptoms needs to be considered and might\ninclude additional intervention on top of OMT:\n• Breathlessness: repeat doses of opioids may be considered for\nthe relief of dyspnoea; however, their effectiveness is not demon-\nstrated.422,423 While using opioids, all patients should be guided\nabout opioid side effects such as constipation and nausea, urinary\nretention, and mental status changes. Benzodiazepines may be\nconsidered as a second- or third-line treatment, when opioids\nand non-pharmacological measures have failed to control breath-\nlessness. Increasing the inspired oxygen concentration may pro-\nvide relief of dyspnoea.\n• Pain: non-pharmacologic management can be helpful. In addition,\nopioid, oxycodone, hydromorphone, and fentanyl are generally\nviewed as safe options and can be provided orally, intravenously,\nand transdermally, especially in the hospital or in patient palliative\ncare or hospice setting.424\n• Anxiety and depression: adequate conventional treatment should\nbe offered.\nProactive decisions and advanced planning with regard to palliative\nand end-of-life care discussions should be documented, regularly\nreviewed, and routinely communicated to all those involved in the\npatient’s care. Healthcare providers should make sure that patients’\nand carer preferences are followed, wherever possible. They should\nalso take into account that patients may choose not to, or may not\nbe in a position to, express preferences (e.g. due to symptoms of\ndepression or cognitive impairment).\n11 Acute heart failure\n11.1 Epidemiology, diagnosis and\nprognosis\nAHF refers to rapid or gradual onset of symptoms and/or signs of\nHF, severe enough for the patient to seek urgent medical atten-\ntion, leading to an unplanned hospital admission or an emergency\ndepartment visit. Patients with AHF require urgent evaluation\nwith subsequent initiation or intensification of treatment, includ-\ning i.v. therapies or procedures. AHF is a leading cause of hospital-\nizations in subjects aged >65 years and is associated with high\nmortality and rehospitalization rates. In-hospital mortality ranges\nfrom 4% to 10%.425\u0002428 Post-discharge 1-year mortality can be\n25\u000230% with up to more than 45% deaths or readmission\nrates.104,426,427,429,430\nAHF may be the first manifestation of HF (new onset) or, more\nfrequently, be due to an acute decompensation of chronic HF.\nCompared to patients with acutely decompensated CHF, those\nwith new onset HF may have a higher in-hospital mortality425 but\nhave\nlower\npost-discharge\nmortality\nand\nrehospitalization\nrates.425,428,431,432 Specific extrinsic factors may precipitate, but\nnot cause, AHF in patients with pre-existing cardiac dysfunction\n(Supplementary Table 16). Clinical severity and in-hospital trajec-\ntory are determined by the complex interplay between precipi-\ntants,\nthe\nunderlying\ncardiac\nsubstrate,\nand\nthe\npatient’s\ncomorbidities.\nTable 18\nPatients with heart failure in whom end-of-life\ncare should be considered\nProgressive functional decline (physical and mental) and dependence in\nmost activities of daily living.\nSevere heart failure symptoms with poor QOL despite optimal pharma-\ncological and non-pharmacological therapies.\nFrequent admissions to hospital or other serious episodes of decompen-\nsation despite optimal treatment.\nHeart transplantation and MCS ruled out.\nCardiac cachexia.\nClinically judged to be close to end of life.\nMCS = mechanical circulatory support; QOL = quality of life.\nTable 19\nKey components of palliative care service in\npatients with advanced heart failure\nFocus on improving or maintaining the QOL of a patient and his/her fam-\nily as well as possible until he/she dies.\nFrequent assessment of symptoms (including dyspnoea and pain) result-\ning from advanced heart failure and other comorbidities and focus on\nsymptom relief.\nAccess for the patient and his/her family to psychological support and spi-\nritual care according to need.\nAdvanced care planning, taking into account preferences for place of\ndeath and resuscitation (which may include deactivating devices, such as\nICD or long-term MCS that may require a multidisciplinary team\ndecision).\nICD = implantable cardioverter-deﬁbrillator; MCS = mechanical circulatory sup-\nport; QOL = quality of life.\nESC 2021\nESC 2021\n3644\nESC Guidelines\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/36/3599/6358045 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n.........................................\nThe diagnostic workup of AHF starts at the time of the first medi-\ncal contact, and is continued throughout the initial patient pathway,\naiming to identify the clinical presentation and to diagnose and\nmanage any potentially reversible causes/precipitants/coexisting\nlife-threatening conditions in a timely manner (Figure 6). Diagnostic\ntests are outlined at Table 20. In addition to clinical signs and symp-\ntoms, diagnostic workup includes ECG and echocardiography, if pos-\nsible. Additional investigations, i.e. chest X-ray and lung ultrasound\nmay be used to confirm AHF diagnosis, especially when NP testing is\nnot available. Plasma NP levels (BNP or NT-proBNP or MR-\nproANP) should be measured if the diagnosis is uncertain and a\npoint-of-care assay is available. Normal concentrations of NPs make\nthe diagnosis of AHF unlikely. Cut-offs for acute HF are: BNP <100\npg/mL, NT-proBNP <300 pg/mL and MR-proANP <120 pg/\nmL.74,433\u0002435 However, elevated NP values are associated with a\nwide range of cardiac and non-cardiac conditions (Table 6). Low con-\ncentrations can be detected in some patients with advanced decom-\npensated end-stage HF, obesity, flash pulmonary oedema or right-\nsided AHF. Higher levels can be found in the patients with concomi-\ntant AF and/or reduced renal function.74\nAmong other laboratory tests, troponin is useful for the detection\nof acute coronary syndrome (ACS) although elevated levels are\ndetected in the vast majority of patients with AHF.436\u0002438 Blood urea\nnitrogen or urea, serum creatinine, electrolytes (sodium, potassium,\nchloride), and antigen carbohydrate 125 may help tailor treat-\nment.439,440 Detection of abnormal liver function identifies patients\nDiagnostic workup of new onset acute heart failure\nElectrocardiogram\nPulse oximetry\nEchocardiography\nInitial laboratory investigationsa\nChest X-ray\nLung ultrasound\nOther specific evaluationsb\nPatient history, signs and/or\nsymptoms suspected of acute HF\nNatriuretic peptide testing\nBNP <100 pg/mL\nNT-proBNP <300 pg/mL\nMR-proANP <120 pg/mL\nBNP ≥ 100 pg/mL\nNT-proBNP ≥300 pg/mLc\nMR-proANP ≥120 pg/mL\nAcute heart failure ruled out\nAcute heart failure confirmed\nComprehensive echocardiography\nFigure 6 Diagnostic workup of new onset acute heart failure.

Distinct from the acute pulmonary oedema phenotype, it\nhas a more gradual onset, and the main alteration is progressive\nfluid retention responsible for systemic congestion. Sometimes,\ncongestion is associated with hypoperfusion.426 The objectives of\ntreatment are identification of precipitants, decongestion, and in\nrare instances, correction of hypoperfusion (Figure 7).\n11.2.2\nAcute pulmonary oedema\nAcute pulmonary oedema is related to lung congestion. Clinical crite-\nria for acute pulmonary oedema diagnosis include dyspnoea with\northopnoea, respiratory failure (hypoxaemia-hypercapnia), tachyp-\nnoea, >25 breaths/min, and increased work of breathing.448\nThree therapies should be commenced, if indicated. First, oxygen,\ngiven as continuous positive airway pressure, non-invasive positive-\npressure-ventilation and/or high-flow nasal cannula, should be\nstarted. Second, i.v. diuretics should be administered, and third, i.v.\nvasodilators may be given if systolic BP (SBP) is high, to reduce LV\nafterload (Figure 8). In a few cases of advanced HF, acute pulmonary\noedema may be associated with low cardiac output and, in this case,\ninotropes, vasopressors, and/or MCS are indicated to restore organ\nperfusion.\n11.2.3\nIsolated right ventricular failure\nRV failure is associated with increased RV and atrial pressure\nand systemic congestion. RV failure may also impair LV filling, and\nultimately reduce systemic cardiac output, through ventricular\ninterdependence.449\nDiuretics are often the first option of therapy for venous conges-\ntion.

Data defining their optimal dosing, timing, and\nmethod of administration are limited. No difference in the primary\nefficacy outcome of patients’ symptoms global assessment was\nshown with a high-dose regimen, compared with a low-dose regi-\nmen, in the DOSE trial. However, there was a greater relief of dysp-\nnoea, change in weight and net fluid loss (with no prognostic role for\nincreases in serum creatinine) in the higher-dose regimen.460\u0002462\nHigh diuretic doses may cause greater neurohormonal activation and\nelectrolyte abnormalities and are often associated with poorer out-\ncomes, although a cause and effect relation cannot be proven by\nthese retrospective analyses.463\u0002466 Based on these observations, it\nmay be appropriate, when starting i.v. diuretic treatment, to use low\ndoses, to assess the diuretic response and increase the dose when\nthat is insufficient.\nDiuretic treatment should be started with an initial i.v. dose of\nfurosemide, or equivalent dose of bumetanide or torasemide,\ncorresponding to 1\u00022 times the daily oral dose taken by the patient\nbefore admission. If the patient was not on oral diuretics, a starting\ndose of 20\u000240 mg of furosemide, or a bolus of 10\u000220 mg i.v. torase-\nmide, can be used.145,467 Furosemide can be given as 2\u00023 daily\nboluses or as a continuous infusion. Daily single bolus administrations\nare discouraged because of the possibility of post-dosing sodium\nretention.145,461 With continuous infusion, a loading dose may be\nused to achieve steady state earlier.

High-quality\nevidence regarding outcomes remains scarce. Hence, the unselected\nuse of MCS in patients with cardiogenic shock is not supported and\nthey require specialist multidisciplinary expertise for implantation\nand management, similar to that outlined for advanced HF centres\n(Supplementary text 11.4; Supplementary Table 22, see also section\n10.2.2).376,496 Recent studies show that a ‘standardized team-based\napproach’ using predefined algorithms for early MCS implant coupled\nwith close monitoring (invasive haemodynamics, lactate, markers of\nend-organ\ndamage)\nmay\npotentially\ntranslate\ninto\nimproved\nsurvival.497\u0002499\nThe Intra-aortic Balloon Pump in Cardiogenic Shock II (IABP-\nSHOCK-II) trial showed no difference in 30-day, as well as in long-\nterm, mortality between intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and OMT\nin patients with cardiogenic shock following acute MI who underwent\nearly revascularization.500\u0002502 According to these results, IABP is not\nroutinely recommended in cardiogenic shock post-MI.

In these cases, LV\nunloading is mandatory and can be achieved by means of transeptal/\nventricular apex vent or adding an unloading device such as the\nImpella device.510,511\n11.3.11 Pre-discharge assessment and post-discharge\nmanagement planning\nA significant proportion of patients with AHF are discharged with\nminimal or no weight loss and, more importantly, persistent conges-\ntion.427,472 Persistent congestion before discharge is associated with\na higher risk of readmission and mortality.426,472 Treatment, including\ndiuretic dose, should therefore be optimized in order to keep the\npatient free of congestion.\nIn those admitted with ADHF, oral OMT should be continued,\nexcept for possible dose reduction or withdrawal if there is haemo-\ndynamic instability (symptomatic hypotension), severely impaired\nrenal function or hyperkalaemia. Once haemodynamic stabilization is\nachieved with i.v. therapy, treatment should be optimized before dis-\ncharge.467 Treatment optimization has three major aims. First, to\nrelieve congestion. Second, to treat comorbidities, such as iron defi-\nciency, that have an impact on post-discharge outcome.512 Third, to\ninitiate, or restart oral, OMT with beneficial effects on outcome.\nDoses may be uptitrated before discharge and/or in the early post-\ndischarge phase.\nStudies have shown that such optimization of medical treatment is\nassociated with a lower risk of 30-day readmission, although prospec-\ntive randomized trials have not been performed, to date.103,467,513\nRetrospective analyses show that discontinuation or dose reduction\nof beta-blocker therapy during an AHF hospitalization is associated\nwith worse outcomes.514 Initiation of ARNI in recently hospitalized\nstable patients with HFrEF, including those who are ACE-I/ARB\nnaı¨ve, is safe and may be considered in this setting.106,107 Safety and\nbetter outcome have also been recently shown in a prospective\nrandomized trial with sotagliflozin in diabetic patients hospitalized for\nHF, irrespective of their LVEF.136\nIt is recommended to have one follow-up visit within 1 to 2 weeks\nafter discharge.515,516 Components of this follow-up visit should\ninclude monitoring of signs and symptoms of HF, assessment of vol-\nume status, BP, heart rate, and laboratory measurements including\nrenal function, electrolytes, and possibly NPs. Iron status and hepatic\nfunction should also be assessed when not done before discharge.\nBased on clinical evaluation and laboratory exams, further optimiza-\ntion and/or initiation of disease-modifying treatment for HFrEF\nshould occur. Retrospective studies show that such an approach is\nassociated with lower 30-day readmission rates although prospective\nrandomized trials have not been performed, to date.513,516\u0002518\n12 Cardiovascular comorbidities\n12.1 Arrhythmias and conduction\ndisturbances\n12.1.1\nAtrial fibrillation\nAF and HF frequently coexist.519,520 They can cause or exacerbate\neach other through mechanisms such as structural cardiac remodel-\nling, activation of neurohormonal systems, and rate-related LV\nimpairment.519\u0002523 The proportion of patients with HF who develop\nAF increases with age and HF severity. When AF causes HF the clini-\ncal course seems more favourable than with other causes of HF (so\ncalled tachycardiomyopathy).524 In contrast, development of AF in\npatients with chronic HF is associated with worse prognosis, includ-\ning stroke and increased mortality.525,526\nThe management of patients with concomitant HF and AF is sum-\nmarized in Figure 14.7,521 It includes:\n(1)\nIdentification and treatment of possible causes or triggers of AF\n(2)\nManagement of HF\n(3)\nPrevention of embolic events\n(4)\nRate control\n(5)\nRhythm control\nIdentification of triggers and management of heart failure\nPotential causes or precipitating factors such as hyperthyroidism,\nelectrolyte disorders, uncontrolled hypertension, mitral valve dis-\nease, and infection should be identified and corrected.\nWorsening congestion due to AF should be managed with diu-\nretics. Congestion relief may reduce sympathetic drive and ventricu-\nlar rate and increase the chance of spontaneous return to SR. The\npresence of AF may reduce or abolish the prognostic benefits of\nbeta-blockers and renders ivabradine ineffective.12,125 Some treat-\nments for HF decrease the risk of developing AF, including ACE-I,\nslightly, and CRT, probably.7,527\nPrevention of embolic events\nUnless contraindicated, an oral, long-term anticoagulant is recom-\nmended in all patients with HF and paroxysmal, persistent, or perma-\nnent AF. Direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are preferred\nRecommendations for pre-discharge and early post-dis-\ncharge follow-up of patients hospitalized for acute heart\nfailure\nRecommendations\nClassa\nLevelb\nIt is recommended that patients hospitalized for\nHF be carefully evaluated to exclude persistent\nsigns of congestion before discharge and to opti-\nmize oral treatment.427,472\nI\nC\nIt is recommended that evidence-based oral\nmedical treatment be administered before\ndischarge.103,513\nI\nC\nAn early follow-up visit is recommended at 1\u00022\nweeks after discharge to assess signs of conges-\ntion, drug tolerance and start and/or uptitrate\nevidence-based therapy.517,518\nI\nC\nFerric carboxymaltose should be considered for\niron deﬁciency, deﬁned as serum ferritin <100\nng/mL or serum ferritin 100\u0002299 ng/mL with\nTSAT <20%, to improve symptoms and reduce\nrehospitalizations.512\nIIa\nB\nHR = heart failure; TSAT = transferrin saturation.\naClass of recommendation.\nbLevel of evidence.\nESC 2021\n...............................................................................\nESC Guidelines\n3657\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/36/3599/6358045 by guest on 14 January 2026",

A strategy of lenient rate control, defined by a resting\nheart rate <110 b.p.m., was compared to a strategy of strict rate con-\ntrol, defined by a heart rate <80 b.p.m. at rest and <110 b.p.m. during\nmoderate exercise, in RACE II and in a pooled analysis of RACE and\nAFFIRM.152,531 The studies showed no differences in outcome\nbetween the two strategies. However, only 10% of the patients in\nRACE II and 17% of those in the pooled analysis had a history of HF\nhospitalization or NYHA class II\u0002III, respectively.152,531 Higher heart\nrates are associated with worse outcomes in observational stud-\nies.532,533 Thus, a lenient rate control is an acceptable initial approach\nwith, however, treatment targeting a lower heart rate in case of per-\nsistent symptoms or cardiac dysfunction likely related to tachycardia\n(e.g. tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy).7,534\nBeta-blockers can be used for rate control in patients with HFrEF\nor HFmrEF because of their established safety in these patients (see\nsection 5.3.2).7,534,535 Digoxin or digitoxin can be considered when\nthe ventricular rate remains high, despite beta-blockers, or when\nbeta-blockers are contraindicated or not tolerated.151,493,536 It may\ntherefore be considered also an alternative to beta-blockers. For\npatients with NYHA class IV and/or haemodynamic instability, i.v.\namiodarone can be considered to reduce ventricular rate.537 For\nHFpEF, there is a paucity of evidence to demonstrate efficacy of any\nagent. The RATE-AF trial compared digoxin with bisoprolol in\npatients with persistent AF and NYHA class II\u0002IV symptoms.\nCompared with bisoprolol, digoxin had the same effect on QOL at 6\nmonths (primary endpoint) and a better effect on EHRA and NYHA\nfunctional class.536 Only 19% of the patients had LVEF <50% so that\nmost of the patients can be considered as having HFmrEF or\nHFpEF.536\nAV node ablation can be considered in patients with poor ventric-\nular rate control despite medical treatment not eligible for rhythm\ncontrol by catheter ablation or in patients with biventricular\npacing.7,538\u0002540\nRhythm control\nUrgent electrical cardioversion is recommended in the setting of\nacute worsening HF in patients presenting with rapid ventricular rates\nand haemodynamic instability, after consideration of the thromboem-\nbolic risk. Cardioversion should be considered also to improve symp-\ntoms in patients who have persistent and symptomatic AF, despite\noptimal pharmacological management. In patients who do not\nreceive chronic therapy with oral anticoagulant and with AF onset\n>48 h, at least 3 weeks of therapeutic anticoagulation or a transoeso-\nphageal echocardiography is needed before cardioversion.7 When\npharmacological cardioversion is preferred, amiodarone is the drug\nof choice as other antiarrhythmic drugs (i.e. propafenone, flecainide,\ndronedarone)\nare\nassociated\nwith\nworse\noutcomes\nin\nHFrEF.186,534,541\u0002544 Amiodarone can help maintain HF patients in\nSR after cardioversion.545,546\nTrials including patients with HF and comparing rate control and\nrhythm control strategies with the latter based on antiarrhythmic\ndrugs failed to show any benefit of one strategy over the oth-\ner.547\u0002550 More recently, EAST-AFNET 4, enrolling patients with\nearly AF, 28.6% with HF, was stopped early after a median follow-up\nof 5.1 years for a lower occurrence of the primary outcome of death,\nstroke, or hospitalization for worsening HF or ACS in the patients\nassigned to early rhythm control vs. those assigned to usual care.551\nHowever, the patients assigned to the rhythm control strategy had a\ncloser follow-up, which may have influenced their better outcome.\nCatheter ablation was performed in a minority of the patients in the\nrhythm control arm (19.4%).551\nLA catheter ablation was compared with MT, rate or rhythm con-\ntrol strategy, in 363 patients with persistent or paroxysmal AF, LVEF\n<35% and an implanted device (ICD or CRT-D) enrolled in the\nCASTLE-AF trial.552 The primary endpoint of all-cause death or HF\nhospitalizations occurred in fewer patients in the ablation group vs.\nthe MT group, 51 patients (28.5%) vs. 82 (44.6%) [hazard ratio (HR);\n95% confidence interval (CI), 0.62; 0.43\u00020.87; P =0.007]. Also, other\nendpoints, all-cause or CV death or worsening HF, were reduced by\ncatheter ablation.552 This trial suggests that catheter ablation can\nimprove the prognosis of patients with HFrEF. However, it enrolled a\nhighly selected population, 363 of 3013 patients, was not blinded, had\ncrossovers between the two treatment strategies and the number of\nevents observed was low: 24 (13.4%) vs. 46 (25.0%) all-cause deaths\nand 37 (20.7%) vs. 66 (35.9%) HF hospitalizations in the ablation and\nMT groups, respectively.552\nThe CABANA trial was an investigator-initiated, open-label, multi-\ncentre, randomized trial enrolling 2204 patients with symptomatic\nAF. The trial failed to show a benefit of AF ablation strategy over\nmedical care on the primary composite endpoint of death, disabling\nstroke, serious bleeding, or cardiac arrest in the overall population.553\nIn an analysis of the 778 patients (35%) with NYHA class symptoms\n>II, the primary outcome occurred in 34 patients (9.0%) in the cathe-\nter ablation group vs. 49 (12.3%) in the drug therapy group (HR; 95%\nCI, 0.64; 0.41\u00020.99).554 However, also in this trial, the number of\nevents was small and HF was defined based only on symptoms with\nLVEF available in 73% of the patients and >50% and 40\u000249% in 79%\nand 11.7% of the cases, respectively.554 Both CASTLE-AF and\nCABANA showed a highly significant effect of catheter ablation on\npatients’ symptoms.552\u0002554\nTwo other prospective trials enrolled patients with HFrEF and\npersistent AF, who were randomized to catheter ablation or MT in\none trial (AMICA trial, n = 140), and to catheter ablation or amio-\ndarone in the other one (AATAC trial, n = 203).555,556 The first trial\nfailed to show any difference in the LVEF increase between the two\ngroups.555 The second trial showed superiority of catheter ablation\nwith respect of AF recurrence, the primary endpoint, with also a\nreduction in unplanned hospitalizations and mortality.556 In contrast\nwith the AMICA trial,555 but in accordance with CASTLE-AF,552\nAATAC also showed a benefit of catheter ablation on LVEF.556\nIn conclusion, there is insufficient evidence in favour of a strategy\nof rhythm control with antiarrhythmic drugs vs. rate control in\npatients with HF and AF.547\u0002551 The results of randomized trials with\nESC Guidelines\n3659\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/36/3599/6358045 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n.............................................................................................................................................................................\ncatheter ablation vs. MT showed a consistent improvement in symp-\ntoms whereas the results on mortality and hospitalization were\nobtained with a relatively small number of events not permitting to\ndraw definitive conclusions.152,548\u0002550,552\u0002554,557\n12.1.2\nVentricular arrhythmias\nVentricular arrhythmias may be a complication, and in some instan-\nces, a cause of HF.

Short-acting nitrates should be used with caution in patients\nwith HF as they cause hypotension.

These patients are at high risk of HF-related events\nand these were the main cause of deaths and hospitalizations in\nthe trial. Rivaroxaban had no effect on these events. In contrast, in\na non-pre-specified subgroup analysis of the COMPASS trial, low\ndose of rivaroxaban, on top of aspirin, was associated with a reduc-\ntion in ischaemic events in patients with HF, mainly HFmrEF or\nHFpEF.580 Based on these data, low-dose rivaroxaban may be con-\nsidered in patients with CAD (or peripheral artery disease) and\nUse of anti-anginal medications in patients with CCS and HFrEF\nBeta-blockers\n(Class I)\nPersistence of\nCCS symptoms\nIn absence of\nimprovement\nTrimetazidine\n(Class IIb)\nNicorandil\n(Class IIb)\nOR\nOR\nOR\nFelopidine\n(Class IIb)\nRanolazine\n(Class IIb)\nNitrates\n(Class IIb)\nAmlodipine\n(Class IIb)\nIvabradine\n(Class IIa)\nHR <70 bpm, and/or\natrial fibrillation\nHR ≥70 bpm, and\nsinus rhythm\nDiltiazem (Class III)\nVerapamil (Class III)\nFigure 15 Algorithm for the medical treatment of chronic coronary syndrome in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.

It can also be caused by mitral annulus enlargement due\nto LA dilation.606 Moderate or severe SMR is associated with an\nextremely poor prognosis in patients with HF.607,608 The assess-\nment of MR aetiology and severity should be performed by an\nexperienced\nechocardiographer\napplying\na\nmulti-parametric\napproach, and ideally in stable patient conditions, after optimization\nof medical and resynchronization therapies. Being SMR a dynamic\ncondition, echocardiographic quantification during exercise may be\nhelpful in patients with moderate SMR at rest and symptoms during\nphysical activity.609 Early referral of patients with HF and moderate\nor severe MR to a multidisciplinary Heart Team, including HF spe-\ncialists, is recommended for assessment and treatment planning.\nThe Heart Team has to verify, first of all, that the patient is on\noptimal therapy, including CRT, when indicated (Figure 17).\nIn patients with severe SMR and HFrEF requiring revascularization,\nmitral valve surgery and CABG should be considered. Isolated mitral\nvalve surgery may be considered in symptomatic patients with severe\nSMR despite optimal therapy and low surgical risk.592\nTwo randomized trials, MITRA-FR and COAPT, evaluated the\neffectiveness of percutaneous edge-to-edge mitral valve repair plus\nOMT compared to OMT alone, in symptomatic patients with\nreduced LVEF (15\u000240% in MITRA-FR and 20\u000250% in COAPT) and\nmoderate-to-severe or severe SMR [effective regurgitant orifice area\n(EROA) >_ 20 mm2 in MITRA-FR and EROA >_ 30 mm2 in\nCOAPT].610\u0002612 MITRA-FR failed to show any benefit from the\nintervention on all-cause mortality or HF hospitalization at 12\nmonths (primary endpoint; HR 1.16, 95% CI 0.73\u00021.84) and at 24\nmonths.610,611 In contrast, COAPT showed a significant reduction in\nhospitalization for HF at 24 months (primary endpoint; HR 0.53, 95%\nCI 0.40\u00020.70) and mortality (secondary endpoint; HR 0.62, 95% CI\n0.46\u00020.82).612 Differences in patient selection, concomitant MT,\nechocardiographic assessment, procedural issues and severity of\nSMR in relation to the degree of LV dilatation may be responsible for\nthe diverging results of the MITRA-FR and COAPT trials.613\u0002615\nThus, percutaneous edge-to-edge mitral valve repair should be con-\nsidered for outcome improvement only in carefully selected patients\nwho remain symptomatic (NYHA class II\u0002IV) despite OMT, with\nmoderate-to-severe or severe SMR (EROA >_30 mm2), favourable\nanatomical conditions, and fulfilling the inclusion criteria of the\nCOAPT study (i.e. LVEF 20\u000250%, LV end-systolic diameter <70\nmm, systolic pulmonary pressure <70 mmHg, absence of moderate\nor severe RV dysfunction, absence of severe TR, absence of haemo-\ndynamic instability) (Figure 17).615,616\nPercutaneous edge-to-to edge mitral valve repair may also be\nconsidered to improve symptoms in patients with advanced HF,\nsevere SMR and severe symptoms despite OMT. In these patients,\ncardiac transplantation or LVAD implantation must also be\nconsidered.376,617\nOther percutaneous mitral valve repair systems, such as indirect\nannuloplasty, are available for treatment of SMR. This approach has a\nshorter learning curve and lesser technical requirements than percu-\ntaneous edge-to-to edge mitral valve repair and does not preclude\ndifferent procedures once it is performed. A sham-controlled\nrandomized trial testing a transcatheter indirect mitral annuloplasty\ndevice met its primary endpoint of mitral regurgitant volume reduc-\ntion with reverse LV and LA remodelling at 12 months.618 Further\nstudies confirmed favourable results on LA volumes and LV remodel-\nling with trends towards improvement in mean 6MWT distance and\nsymptoms and a reduction in HF hospitalizations in an IPD meta-ana-\nlysis.619\u0002622 Transcatheter mitral valve replacement is also emerging\nas a possible alternative option, but randomized trials are still\nlacking.623\nMitral valve interventions are not recommended in patients with a\nlife expectancy of <1 year due to extra-cardiac conditions.592\nRecommendations for the management of valvular\nheart disease in patients with heart failure\nRecommendations\nClassa\nLevelb\nAortic stenosis\nAortic valve intervention, TAVI or SAVR, is rec-\nommended in patients with HF and severe high-\ngradient aortic stenosis to reduce mortality and\nimprove symptoms.594\nI\nB\nIt is recommended that the choice between\nTAVI and SAVR be made by the Heart Team,\naccording to individual patient preference and\nfeatures including age, surgical risk, clinical, ana-\ntomical and procedural aspects, weighing the\nrisks and beneﬁts of each approach.592\nI\nC\nSecondary mitral regurgitation\nPercutaneous edge-to-edge mitral valve repair\nshould be considered in carefully selected\npatients with secondary mitral regurgitation, not\neligible for surgery and not needing coronary\nrevascularization, who are symptomaticc despite\nOMT and who fulﬁl criteriad for achieving a\nreduction in HF hospitalizations.612\nIIa\nB\nIn patients with HF, severe secondary mitral\nregurgitation and CAD who need revasculariza-\ntion, CABG and mitral valve surgery should be\nconsidered.\nIIa\nC\nPercutaneous edge-to-edge mitral valve repair\nmay be considered to improve symptoms in\ncarefully selected patients with secondary mitral\nregurgitation, not eligible for surgery and not\nneeding coronary revascularization, highly symp-\ntomatic despite OMT and who do not fulﬁl crite-\nria for reducing HF hospitalization.617\nIIb\nC\nCABG = coronary artery bypass graft; CAD = coronary artery disease; LVEF = left\nventricular ejection fraction; LVESD = left ventricular end-systolic diameter;\nNYHA = New York Heart Association; OMT = optimal medical therapy; SAVR =\nsurgical aortic valve replacement; TAVI = transcatheter aortic valve implantation;\nTR = tricuspid regurgitation.\naClass of recommendation.\nbLevel of evidence.\ncNYHA class II\u0002IV.\ndAll of the following criteria must be fulﬁlled: LVEF 20\u000250%, LVESD <70 mm,\nsystolic pulmonary pressure <70 mmHg, absence of moderate or severe right\nventricular dysfunction or severe TR, absence of haemodynamic instability.612\nESC 2021\n.......................................................................................................................................\nESC Guidelines\n3665\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/36/3599/6358045 by guest on 14 January 2026",

Preliminary\nresults show improvement in TR severity and symptoms with low\ncomplication rates.625 Further prospective studies are needed to\nshow the prognostic impact of these treatments in HF patients.\n12.4 Hypertension\nArterial hypertension is a leading risk factor for the development of\nHF. Almost two-thirds of HF patients have a past history of hyperten-\nsion.104,626 Clinical trials evaluating antihypertensive strategies and BP\ntargets in patients with HF and hypertension have not been\nperformed.\nTreatment of HFrEF is similar in hypertensive and normotensive\npatients. Recommended medications, including neurohormonal\nantagonists and diuretics, lower also BP. Lifestyle modifications, such\nas weight loss, reduced sodium intake, and increased physical activity,\nare useful adjunctive measures.4 Uncontrolled hypertension in\npatients with HFrEF is rare, provided the patient is receiving OMT at\nrecommended doses for HF. If further BP lowering is required, in\nabsence of signs of fluid overload, amlodipine and felodipine have\nbeen shown to be safe in HFrEF and may be considered.570,571 Non-\ndihydropyridine CCBs (diltiazem and verapamil) and centrally acting\nagents, such as moxonidine, are contraindicated as they are associ-\nated with worse outcomes.627 Alpha-blockers have no effects on sur-\nvival and are therefore not indicated.143 They can be used for the\ntreatment of concomitant prostatic hyperplasia but should be with-\ndrawn in cases of hypotension.\nHypertension is the most important cause of HFpEF, with a preva-\nlence of 60% to 89%.39 Patients with HFpEF also frequently have an\nexaggerated hypertensive response to exercise and may present\nwith hypertensive acute pulmonary oedema.628,629 Antihypertensive\nagents, including ACE-I, ARBs, beta-blockers, CCB, and diuretics\nreduce the incidence of HF.630,631 Reducing BP leads also to LVH\nregression, the degree of which depends on the class of drug used.4\nARBs, ACE-I, and CCBs cause more effective LVH regression than\nbeta-blockers or diuretics.632 Poorly controlled hypertension may\nprecipitate episodes of decompensation. Causes of secondary hyper-\ntension, such as renal vascular or parenchymal disease, primary aldos-\nteronism and obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), should be ruled out\nor, if confirmed, considered for treatment. Treatment of hyperten-\nsion is an important issue in patients with HFpEF, but the optimal\ntreatment strategy is uncertain. The treatment strategy used in\nHFrEF should also be considered in HFpEF.4\nBP targets are uncertain in both HFrEF and HFpEF. However, eval-\nuation of patient’s age and comorbidities (i.e. diabetes, CKD, CAD,\nvalvular heart disease and stroke) can be helpful to personalize the\nBP target.4 Every effort should be made to reach target doses of\nevidence-based medications in HFrEF patients, despite slight hypo-\ntension.4,633 Conversely, in HFpEF patients with LVH and limited pre-\nload reserve, hypotension should be avoided.\n12.5 Stroke\nHF and stroke frequently coexist because of an overlap of shared risk\nfactors and subsequent mechanisms.519,634 A higher risk of stroke is\npresent also in HF patients in SR.39,426,635\u0002637 AF confers an addi-\ntional risk and patients with HF and AF have a five-fold increased risk\ncompared to the control population.519,634,638\nAs a temporal trend, the incidence of stroke is higher in the first\n30 days after HF diagnosis or an episode of HF decompensation and\ndecreases in the first 6 months following the acute event.637,639\nPatients with stroke and HF have higher mortality, more severe neu-\nrological deficits and longer hospital stays than those without\nHF.637,640 Similarly, patients with HF and stroke have a higher mortal-\nity than patients without stroke.640 In COMMANDER-HF, 47.5% of\nstrokes were either disabling, 16.5%, or fatal, 31%.637\nPatients with HF and concomitant AF, including paroxysmal AF,\nhave a CHA2DS2-VASc score of at least 1 and have therefore an indi-\ncation to anticoagulation. The indication to antithrombotic strategies\nin patients with HF and SR is controversial. In the Warfarin and\nAspirin in Reduced Cardiac Ejection Fraction (WARCEF) trial, war-\nfarin reduced ischaemic stroke as compared with aspirin, but\nincreased major haemorrhages and did not influence the primary\nendpoint of ischaemic stroke, intracerebral haemorrhage, or\ndeath.641 Meta-analyses confirm an increased risk of bleeding out-\nweighing ischaemic stroke prevention in placebo-controlled trials in\npatients with HFrEF and SR.642 In COMMANDER-HF, rivaroxaban\n2.5 mg b.i.d. did not improve the composite outcome of all-cause\nmortality, MI or stroke, nor did it favourably influence HF-related\ndeaths or HF hospitalizations.579 There are no data to support a rou-\ntine strategy of anticoagulation in patients with HFrEF in SR who do\nnot have history of paroxysmal AF. However, low-dose rivaroxaban\nmay be considered in patients with concomitant CCS or peripheral\nartery disease, a high risk of stroke and no major haemorrhagic risk\n(see section 12.2).\nPatients with visible intraventricular thrombus or at high throm-\nbotic risk, such as those with history of peripheral embolism or some\npatients with PPCM or LV non-compaction (LVNC), should be con-\nsidered for anticoagulation.3,643\u0002645\n13 Non-cardiovascular\ncomorbidities\n13.1 Diabetes\nTreatment of HF is similar in patients with and without diabetes.6,646\nConversely, antidiabetic drugs differ in their effects in patients with\nHF and preference must be given to drugs that are both safe and\nreduce HF-related events.6,646,647\n3666\nESC Guidelines\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/36/3599/6358045 by guest on 14 January 2026",

Treatment of hyperten-\nsion is an important issue in patients with HFpEF, but the optimal\ntreatment strategy is uncertain. The treatment strategy used in\nHFrEF should also be considered in HFpEF.4\nBP targets are uncertain in both HFrEF and HFpEF. However, eval-\nuation of patient’s age and comorbidities (i.e. diabetes, CKD, CAD,\nvalvular heart disease and stroke) can be helpful to personalize the\nBP target.4 Every effort should be made to reach target doses of\nevidence-based medications in HFrEF patients, despite slight hypo-\ntension.4,633 Conversely, in HFpEF patients with LVH and limited pre-\nload reserve, hypotension should be avoided.\n12.5 Stroke\nHF and stroke frequently coexist because of an overlap of shared risk\nfactors and subsequent mechanisms.519,634 A higher risk of stroke is\npresent also in HF patients in SR.39,426,635\u0002637 AF confers an addi-\ntional risk and patients with HF and AF have a five-fold increased risk\ncompared to the control population.519,634,638\nAs a temporal trend, the incidence of stroke is higher in the first\n30 days after HF diagnosis or an episode of HF decompensation and\ndecreases in the first 6 months following the acute event.637,639\nPatients with stroke and HF have higher mortality, more severe neu-\nrological deficits and longer hospital stays than those without\nHF.637,640 Similarly, patients with HF and stroke have a higher mortal-\nity than patients without stroke.640 In COMMANDER-HF, 47.5% of\nstrokes were either disabling, 16.5%, or fatal, 31%.637\nPatients with HF and concomitant AF, including paroxysmal AF,\nhave a CHA2DS2-VASc score of at least 1 and have therefore an indi-\ncation to anticoagulation. The indication to antithrombotic strategies\nin patients with HF and SR is controversial. In the Warfarin and\nAspirin in Reduced Cardiac Ejection Fraction (WARCEF) trial, war-\nfarin reduced ischaemic stroke as compared with aspirin, but\nincreased major haemorrhages and did not influence the primary\nendpoint of ischaemic stroke, intracerebral haemorrhage, or\ndeath.641 Meta-analyses confirm an increased risk of bleeding out-\nweighing ischaemic stroke prevention in placebo-controlled trials in\npatients with HFrEF and SR.642 In COMMANDER-HF, rivaroxaban\n2.5 mg b.i.d. did not improve the composite outcome of all-cause\nmortality, MI or stroke, nor did it favourably influence HF-related\ndeaths or HF hospitalizations.579 There are no data to support a rou-\ntine strategy of anticoagulation in patients with HFrEF in SR who do\nnot have history of paroxysmal AF. However, low-dose rivaroxaban\nmay be considered in patients with concomitant CCS or peripheral\nartery disease, a high risk of stroke and no major haemorrhagic risk\n(see section 12.2).\nPatients with visible intraventricular thrombus or at high throm-\nbotic risk, such as those with history of peripheral embolism or some\npatients with PPCM or LV non-compaction (LVNC), should be con-\nsidered for anticoagulation.3,643\u0002645\n13 Non-cardiovascular\ncomorbidities\n13.1 Diabetes\nTreatment of HF is similar in patients with and without diabetes.6,646\nConversely, antidiabetic drugs differ in their effects in patients with\nHF and preference must be given to drugs that are both safe and\nreduce HF-related events.6,646,647\n3666\nESC Guidelines\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/36/3599/6358045 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n.............................................................................................\nThe SGLT2 inhibitors canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin,\nertugliflozin and sotagliflozin were studied in patients with established\nCV disease in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME and VERTIS-CV trials,\nwith established CV disease or CV risk factors in the CANVAS and\nDECLARE-TIMI 58 trials, and with CKD and CV risk in the SCORED\ntrial, respectively.293\u0002297 A small proportion of patients had a history\nof HF.

Correction\nmay also be considered at lower TSH levels (7\u000210 mIU/L).672\u0002674\n13.3 Obesity\nObesity is a risk factor for hypertension and CAD and is also associ-\nated with an increased risk of HF. There is possibly a stronger associa-\ntion with HFpEF.258,675\u0002677 Once obese patients have HF, an obesity\nparadox has been described such that overweight or mildly/moder-\nately obese patients have a better prognosis than leaner patients, par-\nticularly compared with those who are underweight.678,679 However,\nother variables may influence this relationship and the obesity para-\ndox is not observed in patients with diabetes.680,681 Second, BMI\ndoes not take into account body composition, e.g. the relation\nbetween lean skeletal muscle mass and fat mass. Obese patients who\nare fit and have a preserved skeletal muscle mass have better progno-\nsis than obese sarcopenic patients.682 Waist circumference or the\nwaist-to-hip ratio, measuring visceral obesity, is less influenced by\nmuscle mass and may have a stronger relationship with outcomes\nthan BMI, especially in female patients.683,684\nBody fat has a major impact on the diagnostic and prognostic value\nof multiple parameters. Obese patients with HF have lower NP con-\ncentrations due to increased expression of clearance receptors and\naugmented peptide degradation by the adipose tissue.74 Peak oxygen\nconsumption adjusted for body weight underestimates exercise\ncapacity in obese patients and an adjustment for lean body mass\nshould be used for risk stratification.96\nObesity may be a major cause of HFpEF and obese HFpEF patients\ndisplay several pathophysiologic mechanisms that differ from non-\nobese patients with HFpEF.258,675\u0002677,685 Caloric restriction and\nexercise training had additive beneficial effects on exercise capacity\nand QOL of patients with obesity and HFpEF in a randomized trial.337\n13.4 Frailty, cachexia, sarcopenia\nFrailty is a multidimensional dynamic state, independent of age, that\nmakes the individual more vulnerable to the effect of stressors.686 HF\nand frailty are two distinct yet commonly associated conditions. The\nassessment of frailty in patients with HF is crucial as it is associated\nwith both unfavourable outcomes and reduced access to, and toler-\nance of, treatments. Several tools have been proposed for frailty\nscreening and assessment in different chronic conditions, including HF.\nThe HFA of ESC has developed a HF-specific tool based on four major\ndomains, clinical, psycho-cognitive, functional, and social.686\nFrailty is more prevalent in patients with HF than in the general pop-\nulation and may occur in up to 45% of the patients, according to a\nrecent meta-analysis.687,688 Patients with HF are up to six times more\nlikely to be frail, and frail people have a significantly increased risk of\ndeveloping HF.689,690 Frailty is associated with a higher risk of death,\nhospitalizations, and functional decline as well as with a longer dura-\ntion of hospital stay.691\u0002693 The treatment of frailty in HF should be\nmultifactorial and targeted to its main components and may include\nphysical rehabilitation with exercise training, nutritional supplementa-\ntion as well as an individualized approach to treating comorbidities.686\nCachexia is defined as a ‘complex metabolic syndrome associated\nwith underlying illness and characterized by loss of muscle with or\nwithout loss of fat mass’.694 Its major clinical feature is a >5%\noedema-free body weight loss during the previous 12 months or\nless.694,695 Cachexia is a generalized wasting process that may coexist\nwith frailty and may occur in 5\u000215% of patients with HF, especially\nthose with HFrEF and more advanced disease status. It is associated\nwith reduced functional capacity and decreased survival.695\u0002698 As it\nis associated with other chronic diseases, such as cancer, alternative,\nnon-cardiac causes for cachexia should always be investigated.699\nSarcopenia is defined by the presence of low muscle mass together\nwith low muscle function, strength, or performance.698 It is usually\nidentified by an appendicular skeletal muscle mass, defined as the sum\nof the muscle mass of the four limbs, 2 standard deviation below the\nmean of a healthy reference group aged 18\u000240years with a cut-off\nvalue of 7.26 kg/m2 for men.688,700,701 It occurs physiologically with\naging. However, it is accelerated by chronic diseases, such as cancer\nand HF. Sarcopenia can be found in 20\u000250% of patients with HFrEF\nand is often associated with frailty and increased morbidity and mortal-\nity. It is a major determinant of outcomes outweighing the effect of\nbody weight and BMI.684,698,701,702 So far, the most effective strategy\nfor sarcopenia treatment is resistance exercise training, possibly com-\nbined with a protein intake of 1\u00021.5 g/kg/day.698,703 Drug treatments,\nincluding anabolic compounds like testosterone, growth hormone,\nghrelin receptor agonists, were tested in small studies, showing favour-\nable results mostly in terms of exercise capacity and muscle\nstrength.697,703\u0002705 There are no data showing a favourable impact of\nsarcopenia treatment on outcomes. However, exercise training has\nfavourable effects in patients with HF (see section 9.4).95,323\u0002329\n13.5 Iron deficiency and anaemia\nIron deficiency and anaemia are common in patients with HF, being\nindependently associated with reduced exercise capacity, recurrent\nHF hospitalizations, and high CV and all-cause mortality.706,707\nAccording to the World Health Organization criteria, anaemia is\ndefined as a haemoglobin concentration <12 g/dL in women and\n<13 g/dL in men. In patients with HF, iron deficiency is defined as\neither a serum ferritin concentration <100 ng/mL or 100\u0002299 ng/\nmL with transferrin saturation (TSAT) <20%.708\u0002710 Ferritin tissue\nexpression and concentration in the peripheral blood is increased by\ninflammation and several disorders such as infection, cancer, liver dis-\nease, and HF itself. Hence, higher cut-off values have been applied for\nthe definition of iron deficiency in patients with HF.709\u0002711 Another\nmarker reflecting depleted intracellular iron can be high serum solu-\nble transferrin receptors, which derives from proteolysis of the mem-\nbrane transferrin receptor. Its synthesis is increased in case of iron\ndeficiency and is not affected by inflammation. High serum soluble\ntransferrin receptors identify patients at high risk of death beyond\nstandard prognostic variables.711,712 However, its applicability for\niron supplementation therapy has not been demonstrated yet.\nIron deficiency, which can be present independently of anaemia, is\npresent in up to 55% of chronic HF patients and in up to 80% of those\nwith AHF.713\u0002716 It may be caused by increased loss, reduced intake\nor absorption (i.e. malnutrition, gut congestion) and/or impaired iron\nmetabolism caused by the chronic inflammatory activation of HF,\nalthough the exact cause of iron deficiency in HF remains unknown.\nIron deficiency may impair functional capacity, precipitate circulatory\n3668\nESC Guidelines\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/36/3599/6358045 by guest on 14 January 2026",

The detection of anaemia and/or iron defi-\nciency should prompt appropriate investigation to define their cause.\nDarbepoetin-alpha failed to reduce all-cause death or HF hospital-\nization and increased the risk of thromboembolic events in the only\nlarge-scale randomized trial in patients with HFrEF and mild to mod-\nerate anaemia.719 As a result, erythropoietin stimulating agents are\nnot indicated for the treatment of anaemia in HF.\nRCTs have shown that iron supplementation with i.v. ferric car-\nboxymaltose is safe and improves symptoms, exercise capacity, and\nQOL of patients with HFrEF and iron deficiency.720\u0002723 Meta-\nanalyses of RCTs showed also a reduction in the risk of the combined\nendpoints of all-cause death or CV hospitalization, CV death or HF\nhospitalization, CV death or recurrent CV or HF hospitaliza-\ntions.724,725 The favourable effects of iron supplementation were\nindependent from anaemia coexistence.726 In AFFIRM-AHF, patients\nhospitalized for HF with LVEF <50% and concomitant iron deficiency\nwere randomized to i.v. ferric carboxymaltose or placebo, repeated\nat 6- and then 12-week intervals if indicated according to repeat iron\nstudies.512 Administration of ferric carboxymaltose did not signifi-\ncantly reduce the primary composite outcome of total HF hospital-\nizations and CV death at 52 weeks (rate ratio 0.79, 95% CI\n0.62\u00021.01, P = 0.059). However, it reduced the composite endpoint\nof first HF hospitalization or CV death (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.66\u00020.98,\nP = 0.030) and total HF hospitalizations (rate ratio 0.74, 95% CI\n0.58\u00020.94, P = 0.013).512 Therefore, iron supplementation with i.v.\nferric carboxymaltose should be considered for the improvement of\nsymptoms, exercise capacity, and QOL in patients with HF and LVEF\n<45%. It should also be considered for the reduction of HF rehospi-\ntalizations in patients with LVEF <50% recently hospitalized for wor-\nsening HF. Ongoing trials are expected to provide more evidence on\nthe effects of ferric carboxymaltose in patients with HFpEF. In addi-\ntion, large outcomes trials with other iron formulations are ongoing\nin HFrEF, HFpEF, and AHF.727 Oral iron therapy is not effective in\niron repletion and did not improve exercise capacity in patients with\nHFrEF and iron deficiency.728 It is therefore not recommended for\nthe treatment of iron deficiency in the patients with HF.\n13.6 Kidney dysfunction\nCKD and HF frequently coexist.471,707,729 They share common risk\nfactors, such as diabetes or hypertension. CKD may worsen CV func-\ntion causing hypertension and vascular calcification. HF may worsen\nrenal function, through the effects of neurohormonal and inflamma-\ntory activation, increased venous pressure and hypoperfusion.\nOxidative stress and fibrosis likely play a major role as pathogenic\nmechanisms in HF with CKD.730,731\nWhile CKD and worsening renal function both appear more\ncommon in HFpEF as compared to in HFmrEF and HFrEF, perhaps\ndue to shared pathophysiological mechanisms, they appear to be less\nassociated with worse outcomes in HFpEF than in HFmrEF and\nHFrEF.732,733\nCKD is a major independent determinant of increased mortality and\nmorbidity in HF.471,734\u0002736 However, there are settings in which\nchanges in serum creatinine are not associated with worse outcomes.\nWhen RAAS inhibitors, ARNI or SGLT2 inhibitors are started, the ini-\ntial decrease in the glomerular filtration pressure may decrease GFR\nand increase serum creatinine. However, these changes are generally\ntransient and occur despite improvement in patient outcomes and\nslower worsening of renal function in the long term. For instance, in\nEMPEROR-Reduced, the placebo-corrected eGFR dip induced by\nempagliflozin at week 4 was of 2.4 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with\nCKD and 2.7 mL/min/1.73 m2 for those without CKD, corresponding\nto a decrease from baseline of 5.2% and 3.8%, respectively. This was\nfollowed by a slower slope of eGFR decline and by a reduced rate of\nthe composite kidney outcome with empagliflozin vs. placebo, with no\ndifference between patients with or without CKD at baseline.109,737\nThus, with respect to the initiation of RAAS inhibitors, ARNI or\nSGLT2 inhibitors, a transient decrease in renal function should not\nprompt their interruption. An increase in serum creatinine of <50%\nabove baseline, as long as it is <266 lmol/L (3 mg/dL), or a decrease in\neGFR of <10% from baseline, as long as eGFR is >25 mL/min/1.73 m2,\ncan be considered as acceptable (see section 5.3 and Supplementary\nTable 8). Also, with respect to diuretic therapy, small and transient\nrises in serum creatinine during treatment of acute HF are not associ-\nated\nwith\npoorer\noutcomes\nwhen\nthe\npatient\nis\nfree\nof\ncongestion.108,109,460\u0002462,471,729,737\u0002740\nRandomized trials have shown that patients with HF and concomi-\ntant CKD are at higher risk of events but the beneficial effects of MT\nRecommendations for the management of anaemia and\niron deﬁciency in patients with heart failure\nRecommendations\nClassa\nLevelb\nIt is recommended that all patients with HF be\nperiodically screened for anaemia and iron deﬁ-\nciency with a full blood count, serum ferritin\nconcentration, and TSAT.\nI\nC\nIntravenous iron supplementation with ferric\ncarboxymaltose should be considered in symp-\ntomatic patients with LVEF <45% and iron deﬁ-\nciency, deﬁned as serum ferritin <100 ng/mL or\nserum ferritin 100\u0002299 ng/mL with TSAT\n<20%, to alleviate HF symptoms, improve exer-\ncise capacity and QOL.720,722,724\nIIa\nA\nIntravenous iron supplementation with ferric\ncarboxymaltose should be considered in symp-\ntomatic HF patients recently hospitalized for HF\nand with LVEF <50% and iron deﬁciency, deﬁned\nas serum ferritin <100 ng/mL or serum ferritin\n100\u0002299 ng/mL with TSAT <20%, to reduce\nthe risk of HF hospitalization.512\nIIa\nB\nHF = heart failure; LVEF = left ventricular ejection fraction; QOL = quality of life;\nTSAT = transferrin saturation.\naClass of recommendation.\nbLevel of evidence.\nESC 2021\nESC Guidelines\n3669\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/36/3599/6358045 by guest on 14 January 2026",

Ongoing trials are expected to provide more evidence on\nthe effects of ferric carboxymaltose in patients with HFpEF. In addi-\ntion, large outcomes trials with other iron formulations are ongoing\nin HFrEF, HFpEF, and AHF.727 Oral iron therapy is not effective in\niron repletion and did not improve exercise capacity in patients with\nHFrEF and iron deficiency.728 It is therefore not recommended for\nthe treatment of iron deficiency in the patients with HF.\n13.6 Kidney dysfunction\nCKD and HF frequently coexist.471,707,729 They share common risk\nfactors, such as diabetes or hypertension.

However, these changes are generally\ntransient and occur despite improvement in patient outcomes and\nslower worsening of renal function in the long term. For instance, in\nEMPEROR-Reduced, the placebo-corrected eGFR dip induced by\nempagliflozin at week 4 was of 2.4 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with\nCKD and 2.7 mL/min/1.73 m2 for those without CKD, corresponding\nto a decrease from baseline of 5.2% and 3.8%, respectively. This was\nfollowed by a slower slope of eGFR decline and by a reduced rate of\nthe composite kidney outcome with empagliflozin vs. placebo, with no\ndifference between patients with or without CKD at baseline.109,737\nThus, with respect to the initiation of RAAS inhibitors, ARNI or\nSGLT2 inhibitors, a transient decrease in renal function should not\nprompt their interruption. An increase in serum creatinine of <50%\nabove baseline, as long as it is <266 lmol/L (3 mg/dL), or a decrease in\neGFR of <10% from baseline, as long as eGFR is >25 mL/min/1.73 m2,\ncan be considered as acceptable (see section 5.3 and Supplementary\nTable 8).

The detection of anaemia and/or iron defi-\nciency should prompt appropriate investigation to define their cause.\nDarbepoetin-alpha failed to reduce all-cause death or HF hospital-\nization and increased the risk of thromboembolic events in the only\nlarge-scale randomized trial in patients with HFrEF and mild to mod-\nerate anaemia.719 As a result, erythropoietin stimulating agents are\nnot indicated for the treatment of anaemia in HF.\nRCTs have shown that iron supplementation with i.v. ferric car-\nboxymaltose is safe and improves symptoms, exercise capacity, and\nQOL of patients with HFrEF and iron deficiency.720\u0002723 Meta-\nanalyses of RCTs showed also a reduction in the risk of the combined\nendpoints of all-cause death or CV hospitalization, CV death or HF\nhospitalization, CV death or recurrent CV or HF hospitaliza-\ntions.724,725 The favourable effects of iron supplementation were\nindependent from anaemia coexistence.726 In AFFIRM-AHF, patients\nhospitalized for HF with LVEF <50% and concomitant iron deficiency\nwere randomized to i.v. ferric carboxymaltose or placebo, repeated\nat 6- and then 12-week intervals if indicated according to repeat iron\nstudies.512 Administration of ferric carboxymaltose did not signifi-\ncantly reduce the primary composite outcome of total HF hospital-\nizations and CV death at 52 weeks (rate ratio 0.79, 95% CI\n0.62\u00021.01, P = 0.059). However, it reduced the composite endpoint\nof first HF hospitalization or CV death (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.66\u00020.98,\nP = 0.030) and total HF hospitalizations (rate ratio 0.74, 95% CI\n0.58\u00020.94, P = 0.013).512 Therefore, iron supplementation with i.v.\nferric carboxymaltose should be considered for the improvement of\nsymptoms, exercise capacity, and QOL in patients with HF and LVEF\n<45%. It should also be considered for the reduction of HF rehospi-\ntalizations in patients with LVEF <50% recently hospitalized for wor-\nsening HF. Ongoing trials are expected to provide more evidence on\nthe effects of ferric carboxymaltose in patients with HFpEF. In addi-\ntion, large outcomes trials with other iron formulations are ongoing\nin HFrEF, HFpEF, and AHF.727 Oral iron therapy is not effective in\niron repletion and did not improve exercise capacity in patients with\nHFrEF and iron deficiency.728 It is therefore not recommended for\nthe treatment of iron deficiency in the patients with HF.\n13.6 Kidney dysfunction\nCKD and HF frequently coexist.471,707,729 They share common risk\nfactors, such as diabetes or hypertension. CKD may worsen CV func-\ntion causing hypertension and vascular calcification. HF may worsen\nrenal function, through the effects of neurohormonal and inflamma-\ntory activation, increased venous pressure and hypoperfusion.\nOxidative stress and fibrosis likely play a major role as pathogenic\nmechanisms in HF with CKD.730,731\nWhile CKD and worsening renal function both appear more\ncommon in HFpEF as compared to in HFmrEF and HFrEF, perhaps\ndue to shared pathophysiological mechanisms, they appear to be less\nassociated with worse outcomes in HFpEF than in HFmrEF and\nHFrEF.732,733\nCKD is a major independent determinant of increased mortality and\nmorbidity in HF.471,734\u0002736 However, there are settings in which\nchanges in serum creatinine are not associated with worse outcomes.\nWhen RAAS inhibitors, ARNI or SGLT2 inhibitors are started, the ini-\ntial decrease in the glomerular filtration pressure may decrease GFR\nand increase serum creatinine. However, these changes are generally\ntransient and occur despite improvement in patient outcomes and\nslower worsening of renal function in the long term. For instance, in\nEMPEROR-Reduced, the placebo-corrected eGFR dip induced by\nempagliflozin at week 4 was of 2.4 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with\nCKD and 2.7 mL/min/1.73 m2 for those without CKD, corresponding\nto a decrease from baseline of 5.2% and 3.8%, respectively. This was\nfollowed by a slower slope of eGFR decline and by a reduced rate of\nthe composite kidney outcome with empagliflozin vs. placebo, with no\ndifference between patients with or without CKD at baseline.109,737\nThus, with respect to the initiation of RAAS inhibitors, ARNI or\nSGLT2 inhibitors, a transient decrease in renal function should not\nprompt their interruption. An increase in serum creatinine of <50%\nabove baseline, as long as it is <266 lmol/L (3 mg/dL), or a decrease in\neGFR of <10% from baseline, as long as eGFR is >25 mL/min/1.73 m2,\ncan be considered as acceptable (see section 5.3 and Supplementary\nTable 8). Also, with respect to diuretic therapy, small and transient\nrises in serum creatinine during treatment of acute HF are not associ-\nated\nwith\npoorer\noutcomes\nwhen\nthe\npatient\nis\nfree\nof\ncongestion.108,109,460\u0002462,471,729,737\u0002740\nRandomized trials have shown that patients with HF and concomi-\ntant CKD are at higher risk of events but the beneficial effects of MT\nRecommendations for the management of anaemia and\niron deﬁciency in patients with heart failure\nRecommendations\nClassa\nLevelb\nIt is recommended that all patients with HF be\nperiodically screened for anaemia and iron deﬁ-\nciency with a full blood count, serum ferritin\nconcentration, and TSAT.\nI\nC\nIntravenous iron supplementation with ferric\ncarboxymaltose should be considered in symp-\ntomatic patients with LVEF <45% and iron deﬁ-\nciency, deﬁned as serum ferritin <100 ng/mL or\nserum ferritin 100\u0002299 ng/mL with TSAT\n<20%, to alleviate HF symptoms, improve exer-\ncise capacity and QOL.720,722,724\nIIa\nA\nIntravenous iron supplementation with ferric\ncarboxymaltose should be considered in symp-\ntomatic HF patients recently hospitalized for HF\nand with LVEF <50% and iron deﬁciency, deﬁned\nas serum ferritin <100 ng/mL or serum ferritin\n100\u0002299 ng/mL with TSAT <20%, to reduce\nthe risk of HF hospitalization.512\nIIa\nB\nHF = heart failure; LVEF = left ventricular ejection fraction; QOL = quality of life;\nTSAT = transferrin saturation.\naClass of recommendation.\nbLevel of evidence.\nESC 2021\nESC Guidelines\n3669\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/36/3599/6358045 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n.......................................................................................................................................................................\nare similar, if not greater, than in the patients with normal renal func-\ntion.206,471,741,742 Beta-blockers reduce mortality in HFrEF patients\nwith moderate (eGFR 45\u000259 mL/min/1.73 m2) and moderately\nsevere (eGFR 30\u000244 mL/min/1.73 m2) renal dysfunction, whereas\nlimited evidence is available regarding patients with severe renal\nimpairment (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2).743 Sacubitril/valsartan,\ncompared with enalapril, led to a slower decline in renal function,\ndespite a slight increase in the urinary albumin/creatinine ratio, and\nimproved CV outcomes to a similar extent in patients with CKD vs.\nthe others in PARADIGM-HF.127 SGLT2 inhibitors lead to a slower\ndecline in renal function, compared with placebo, both in patients\nwith HFrEF and in those with CKD.108,109,737,738,744 The improve-\nment in cardiac output after CRT or LVAD implantation may be\nassociated with, at least, a transient improvement in renal func-\ntion.471,745,746 The benefits of ICDs may be reduced in patients with\nsevere renal dysfunction because of the competing risk of non-\narrhythmic causes of death.747\u0002749\nThere is little direct evidence to support any recommendations\nfor treatment of HF patients with severe CKD as to date, RCTs\nexcluded patients with advanced stages of CKD, i.e. eGFR <30 mL/\nmin/1.73 m2 (Supplementary Table 23).

It may cause\nlethal ventricular arrhythmias and increase CV mortality. Its treat-\nment includes the use of RAAS inhibitors, potassium-sparing diu-\nretics, and prescription of oral potassium supplements (i.e. potassium\nchloride tablets). When oral administration is not possible, potassium\nsupplementation by infusion may be necessary (20 to 40 mmol of\npotassium in 250\u00021000 mL of normal saline). Potassium-rich solu-\ntion should be infused at slow rate through a large vein using a venous\ncatheter.\nHyperkalaemia is defined as serum potassium >5 mmol/L and can\nbe classified as mild (>5.0 to <5.5 mmol/L), moderate (5.5 to 6.0\nmmol/L), or severe (>6.0 mmol/L).760 It is associated with an\nincreased\nrisk\nof\nhospitalization\nand\ndeath.752,753,755,756,761,762\nHyperkalaemia can be associated with the administration of RAAS\ninhibitors, CKD and increased absorption.760 Among patients with\nHF, the prevalence of hyperkalaemia at any given time among patients\nwith HF appears to be less than 5%,757 but the incidence is much\nhigher, at up to 40% in chronic HF and 73% in CKD over follow-up\ndurations of approximately 1 year.753,756,757,763\u0002765 In PARADIGM-\nHF, treatment with sacubitril/valsartan was associated with lower risk\nof severe hyperkalaemia, compared with enalapril.128 Life-threatening\nhyperkalaemia requires immediate treatment with a combination of\ncalcium carbonate and/or sodium bicarbonate, insulin, with or with-\nout glucose, and beta adrenoceptor agonists [e.g. salbutamol, off-\nlabel use in some European Union (EU) countries]. These agents\nfavour potassium entry into the cells and do not increase potassium\nexcretion. Thus, they only provide temporary benefit and rebound\nhyperkalaemia can occur after few hours. Loop diuretics can be\nadministered to facilitate potassium loss.\nPotassium binders bind to potassium in the gastrointestinal tract\nreducing its absorption. They can be used for acute and chronic\npotassium lowering. They include sodium polystyrene sulfonate, cal-\ncium polystyrene sulfonate, and the much better tolerated patiromer\nsorbitex calcium and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC). Sodium\npolystyrene sulfonate is still indicated in anuric or severely oliguric\npatients, but it should not be used in the medium or long term as it\nmay cause severe gastrointestinal side effects, including bowel\nnecrosis.760 Patiromer or SZC increase faecal potassium excretion\nand act mainly in the colon. Both compounds are effective in normal-\nizing elevated potassium levels, maintaining normokalaemia over time\nand preventing the recurrence of hyperkalaemia and can be consid-\nered for treatment of hyperkalaemia766\u0002768 (see Supplementary Table\n24).\nRenal dysfunction and hyperkalaemia are the major causes of\nunderuse\nof\nRAAS\ninhibitors,\nparticularly\nMRA,\nin\nclinical\npractice.342,753,758,769\u0002771 Administration of the potassium-lowering\nagents, patiromer or SZC, may allow their initiation or uptitration in\na larger proportion of patients.

As the\npathogenesis of hyponatraemia in HF is dilutional, e.g. caused by\nwater retention induced by increased vasopressin secretion, treat-\nment is based on water restriction or vasopressin antagonists. Fluid\nrestrictions to less than 800\u00021000 mL/day may be indicated to\nachieve a negative water balance and treat hyponatraemia. Water\nrestriction was associated with improved QOL in a small, random-\nized study but with only slight increases in serum sodium in an obser-\nvational registry.780,781 Tolvaptan, an orally active selective arginine\nvasopressin V2 receptor antagonist, can be considered to increase\nserum sodium and diuresis in patients with persistent hyponatraemia\nand congestion. However, no effects on outcomes have been shown\nin RCTs782\u0002785 (see Supplementary text 13.1). The infusion of hyper-\ntonic saline combined with loop diuretics was associated with an\nincrease in serum sodium levels and greater diuretic efficacy in small\ntrials and observational studies.786\u0002788\nHypochloraemia (<96 mmol/L) is a powerful independent predic-\ntor of mortality in patients with acute and chronic HF.439,789\u0002792\nSerum chloride may have a direct role in the control of renin secre-\ntion and the response to loop or thiazide diuretics.439,793 The car-\nbonic\nanhydrase\ninhibitor\nacetazolamide\nincreases\nchloride\nreabsorption causing a greater bicarbonate and sodium excretion in\nthe proximal tubule of the nephron. It can increase serum chloride\nlevels and diuresis in patients with severe HF at risk of diuretic resist-\nance.145,794 It is currently being tested in a multicentre randomized\nstudy in decompensated HF.469\n13.8 Lung disease, sleep-disordered\nbreathing\nOverall, COPD affects about 20% of patients with HF and has a major\nimpact on symptoms and outcomes.795\u0002797 Due to the overlap in\nsymptoms and signs, the differentiation between HF and COPD may\nbe difficult. Pulmonary function testing with spirometry is recom-\nmended as the first diagnostic tool and should be considered in\npatients with suspected COPD. For adequate interpretation, it\nshould be performed in stable and euvolaemic patients to avoid con-\ngestion related to obstructive pulmonary function patterns. If there is\nuncertainty about the reversibility of airflow obstruction, pneumol-\nogy referral for more sophisticated tests (bronchodilatatory test,\nbronchial provocation tests, diffusion capacity) is warranted.798,799\nTreatment of HF is generally well tolerated in COPD.800 Beta-\nblockers can worsen pulmonary function in individual patients but\nare not contraindicated in either COPD or asthma, as stated in the\nGlobal initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) and\nthe Global INitiative for Asthma (GINA), respectively.801,802 GINA\nstates that asthma should not be regarded as an absolute contraindi-\ncation to the use of cardioselective beta-blockers (bisoprolol, meto-\nprolol succinate, or nebivolol) with consideration of relative risks and\nbenefits. In clinical practice, starting with low doses of cardioselective\nbeta-blockers combined with close monitoring for signs of airway\nobstruction (wheezing, shortness of breath with lengthening of the\nexpiration) should be encouraged. Although not tested in HF\npatients, inhaled corticosteroids and beta-adrenergic agonists do not\nseem to increase CV events, including HF, in patients at high\nrisk.803,804 Moreover, optimal COPD management can improve car-\ndiac function.805\nSleep-disordered breathing occurs in more than one third of\npatients with HF and is even more prevalent in patients with AHF.\nThe most common types are: central sleep apnoea (CSA, similar to\nCheyne-Stokes respiration), OSA, and a mixed pattern of the two.\nCSA and OSA have been shown to be associated with a worse prog-\nnosis in HF. OSA is associated with an increased risk of incident HF in\nmen. CSA is the most common form of sleep-disordered breathing\nin HFrEF and HFmrEF is the most common cause of CSA.806,807\nPatients with HF can be investigated for sleep-disordered breath-\ning. History taking should involve partners. Questionnaires are instru-\nmental in identifying patients at risk. Home monitoring can usually\nidentify and distinguish the type of sleep apnoea.

Numerous classes of CV drugs, particularly diu-\nretics and beta-blockers, have been implicated causing erectile dys-\nfunction. However, the relationships between many contemporary\nCV drugs and erectile dysfunction is not clear.834 For the treatment\nof erectile dysfunction, phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors are gen-\nerally safe and effective in patients with compensated HF.834,835 No\nstudies have shown one agent to be more effective or safer than the\nothers. However, phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors should not be\nused in patients receiving nitrates and nitrates should not be adminis-\ntered to patients within 24 h of sildenafil or vardenafil administration\nor within 48 h of tadalafil administration.834\n13.12 Depression\nDepression affects 20% of patients with HF and is severe in half of\nthem. Its occurrence is higher in women and it is associated with\nworse clinical status and a poor prognosis.836\u0002838 Screening using a\nvalidated questionnaire is recommended when there is a clinical sus-\npicion of depression.

Other questionnaires (e.g.\nGeriatric Depression Scale, Hamilton Depression Scale, Hospital\nAnxiety and Depression Scale) can also be used.837,838\nThere is still no consensus on the best therapy for HF patients\nwith depression. Psychosocial intervention may improve depressive\nsymptoms but has no effect on prognosis of depressed patients with\nHF.839 Depressive symptoms may improve with selective serotonin\nreuptake inhibitors but trials specifically designed to assess the effect\nof these drugs in patients with HF and depression have failed to show\nany significant benefit over placebo on both symptoms and out-\ncomes.840,841 Interestingly, patients improved also in the placebo arm\nshowing the importance of better care in these patients. Both trials\nshowed the safety of sertraline and escitalopram, respectively.840,841\nTricyclic antidepressants should be avoided for the treatment of\ndepression in HF as they may cause hypotension, worsening HF, and\narrhythmias.837,838\n13.13 Cancer\nHF occurs in patients with cancer as a result of the interaction among\nanticancer therapy, cancer itself, and patients’ CV background (risk\nfactors and coexisting CV disease).842\u0002846 Several anticancer thera-\npies may cause HF directly, thorough their cardiotoxic effects (Table\n23), or, indirectly, through other mechanisms, such as myocarditis,\nischaemia, systemic or pulmonary hypertension, arrhythmias or valve\ndisease.844,845,847\u0002852 HF, in turn, may affect cancer outcomes by\ndepriving patients of effective anticancer therapies.699 Some epide-\nmiological and experimental evidence suggests a further reciprocal\ninteraction between cancer and HF with some, though not all, studies\nshowing a higher incidence rate of cancer in patients with HF.853\u0002858\nThe prevention of HF in patients with cancer undergoing potential\ncardiotoxic therapies requires careful patient’s assessment and man-\nagement before, during, and after cancer therapy, preferably in the\ncontext\nof\nan\nintegrated\nCardio-Oncology\nservice\n(Figure 18).845,859,860 A CV baseline risk assessment for all patients\nscheduled to receive potentially cardiotoxic cancer therapies using\nthe HFA-ICOS risk assessment is advisable.846 Baseline CV risk\nassessment forms have been developed for different potentially car-\ndiotoxic cancer therapies. History of HF or CMP characterizes\npatients as being at very high risk or at high risk for all cancer thera-\npies, except anti-androgen treatments for prostate cancer.

An LVEF <30%,\nmarked LV dilatation, LV end-diastolic diameter >6.0 cm, and RV\ninvolvement are associated with adverse outcomes.643 Cardiac\nrecovery may occur in the first 3\u00026 months though it may be\ndelayed to up to 2 years. Recovery rates vary among regions, from\n75% to less than 50%.886\u0002888\nAssessment and management of pregnant patients presenting with\nHF depends upon the clinical setting and severity of presentation.\nDetailed cardiac assessment with echocardiography, NP levels, foetal\nultrasound and foetal monitoring is recommended. In cases of new\nHF or if there is diagnostic uncertainty non-contrast CMR may be\nconsidered.\nMilder cases can be treated with oral diuretics, beta-blockers,\nhydralazine and oral nitrates. Pregnant women presenting with signs\nof acute HF require urgent hospital admission. In case of PPCM pre-\nsenting with severe HF and cardiogenic shock requiring inotropic or\nvasopressor support, transfer to an advanced HF centre, where\nECMO, LVAD and/or cardiac transplantation can be performed, is\nrecommended. Urgent delivery by caesarean section (irrespective of\ngestation) should be considered with MCS immediately available.\nAdrenergic agents (dobutamine, adrenaline) may have detrimental\neffects.889 When a PPCM patient is haemodynamically unstable, levo-\nsimendan or MCS may be considered. LVAD implantation as a BTT\nor BTR should be considered in refractory cases of cardiogenic\nshock.643 Bromocriptine has been proposed for patients with acute\nPPCM to reduce the production of a cleaved 16 kDa prolactin frag-\nment, which may contribute to the pathophysiology of PPCM.\nBromocriptine was tested in a randomized trial in 63 patients com-\nparing its long-term, 8 weeks, with its short-term, 1-week, treatment.\nIt was associated with recovery of LV function, with no difference\nbetween the two regimens and in line with the results of a previous\ninternational PPCM registry.890,891 Bromocriptine may be considered\nfor treatment of PPCM. Untoward effects of treatment, including\ndeep venous thrombosis and cessation of lactation, must be consid-\nered if it is initiated. It should therefore be accompanied by prophy-\nlactic (or therapeutic) anticoagulation.\n14.2 Cardiomyopathies\n14.2.1\nEpidemiology and diagnosis\nCMPs can be either inherited (genetic/familial) and/or acquired. They\ncan also be accelerated by disease modifiers.892\u0002894 They are a heter-\nogeneous group of diseases and are major causes of HF.895 DCM has\nan estimated prevalence of 1 in 250 to 1 in 500 of the general popula-\ntion, HCM ranges between 1 in 500 to 1 in 5000, and AC is estimated\nto be present in around 1 in 1000 to 1 in 5000 persons.895,896\nDirect causes of CMPs include pathogenic gene variants (muta-\ntions), toxins, auto-immunity, storage diseases, infections, and\ntachyarrhythmias. Disease modifiers, conditions that may aggravate\nor trigger a CMP, include epigenetic factors and acquired modifiers,\nsuch as pregnancy and most CV comorbidities. It is important to\nconsider this key interaction between genetic and acquired causes\nduring the diagnostic workup.897 Identification of an acquired cause\nof the CMP does not exclude an underlying pathogenic gene variant,\nwhereas the latter may require an additional acquired cause and/or\ndisease modifier to become manifest clinically. The commonest\ncauses and disease modifiers are shown in Table 25.\nThe key elements of the diagnostic workup for all patients with HF\nand CMP are reported in Table 26.892,894,895,898,899 Specifics aspects\nof diagnosis and treatment are summarized in Tables 27\u000229. Clinical\nhistory, laboratory tests, and imaging are the first-line investigations.\nEchocardiography is central for the diagnosis and monitoring of\nHCM, DCM, and AC. CMR imaging provides more detailed morpho-\nlogical and prognostic information and should be performed\nat baseline. The prevalence of gene mutations may vary according\nto the morphological phenotype or the underlying acquired\ncause. Gene mutations occur in up to 40% of DCM, 60% of\nHCM, and 15% in chemotherapy-induced, alcoholic or peripartum\nCMPs.895,898,900\u0002905 The prevalence of genetic mutations is over\n10% also in non-familial DCM.898,906 Finding a pathogenic gene var-\niant in a patient with CMP allows better prediction of the disease out-\ncome and progression, may contribute to the indications for device\nimplantation and inform genetic counselling for families.\nEndomyocardial biopsy (EMB) with immunohistochemical quantifi-\ncation of inflammatory cells remains the gold standard investigation\nfor the identification of cardiac inflammation. It may confirm the diag-\nnosis of auto-immune disease in patients with DCM and suspected\ngiant cell myocarditis, eosinophilic myocarditis, vasculitis and sarcoi-\ndosis.893,907 It may also help for the diagnosis of storage diseases,\nincluding amyloid or Fabry disease, if imaging or genetic testing does\nnot provide a definitive diagnosis (see also section 14.6). EMB might\nbe considered also in HCM if genetic or acquired causes cannot be\nidentified. The risks and benefits of EBM should be evaluated and this\nprocedure should be reserved for specific situations where its results\nmay affect treatment.\n14.2.2\nTreatment\nThe current pharmacological treatment of HF in DCM, HCM, or AC\npatients does not differ from general HF management, except for\npeculiar aspects reported in Tables 27\u000229. A pilot randomized study,\nTRED-HF, investigated the possibility of withdrawing medical treat-\nment in those patients with non-ischaemic DCM who had had partial\nto complete recovery of LVEF (>40%). However, relapse of DCM\nwithin 6 months was observed in 44% of patients, and rapid LV\nremodelling with early tissue and functional changes, even amongst\npatients who did not relapse, was found.271,908\nIn a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial\n(EXPLORER-HCM), treatment with mavacamten improved exercise\ncapacity, LVOT obstruction, NYHA functional class, and health status\nin patients with obstructive HCM. This offers the possibility of\ndisease-specific treatment for inherited CMPs. 909\nICD implantation should be considered for patients with DCM,\nHCM, or AC (see section 6).895,910\u0002912 The strength of the indication\nvaries according to the clinical risk factors for sudden cardiac death\nwith higher priority being given to those patients with significant LGE\nESC Guidelines\n3677\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/36/3599/6358045 by guest on 14 January 2026",

Quite commonly individuals with\nfeatures of LVNC are found in families where other affected rela-\ntives have typical HCM or DCM. Therefore, LVNC is not treated\nas a separate disease entity, but as a separate rare presentation of\na genetic susceptibility to either HCM or DCM.939\n14.4 Atrial disease\n14.4.1\nDefinition\nAtrial disease, also termed atrial failure or myopathy, can be defined\nas a complex of subclinical structural, electrophysiological, and func-\ntional changes that affect the atria with the potential to produce\nclinical consequences.606,940,941 It has been suggested that atrial dis-\nease links the pathophysiology of HF, especially HFpEF, with AF, as\nthey often coexist, are closely inter-related and share common risk\nfactors.606,685,942,943\n14.4.2\nDiagnosis\nAtrial size and function can be evaluated by multimodality imaging\nincluding two- and three-dimensional echocardiography, myocar-\ndial deformation, computed tomography (CT) and CMR.944\nCardiac biomarkers, including high-sensitivity cardiac troponins\nand NPs, may assess pathophysiological aspects of atrial dis-\nease.945\u0002947 The increased levels of NPs in AF may also be an indi-\ncator of an underlying atrial disease.942,948 A comprehensive\ncharacterization of atrial disease combining clinical, imaging, bio-\nchemical and molecular features is, however, still lacking.\n14.4.3\nManagement\nAtrial disease is an emerging therapeutic target in the prevention of\nAF, systemic thromboembolism, and perhaps HFpEF.949 As atrial\ndisease appears to result from the intersection of shared risk factors\nand comorbidities predisposing to both AF and HF, diabetes mellitus,\nhypertension, obesity, smoking, and physical inactivity may be of para-\nmount importance for its development.7,950 Effective management of\nHF and AF (see section 12.1.1), as well as treatment of mitral regurgi-\ntation (see section 12.3.3), may also be important to counteract atrial\ndisease progression.\n14.5 Myocarditis\n14.5.1\nEpidemiology and diagnosis\nThe incidence of acute myocarditis is estimated to be 1.5 million cases\nper year globally.951 The contribution of myocarditis as a cause of HF\nvaries by age and region from approximately 0.5% to 4.0%.918,952\nChronic, EMB proven, inflammation can be found in 9% to 30% of adult\npatients with a DCM.918,953 The most frequent potential aetiologies\ntriggering acute myocarditis in Europe are reported in Table 30.\nThe clinical presentation of acute myocarditis may vary from mild\nsymptoms to cardiogenic shock.

Their withdrawal must be often considered due to\nhypotension and/or bradycardia.973,974 CCB should be avoided as\nthey may cause severe hypotension and fatigue, or form com-\nplexes with amyloid.966\nAmyloid infiltration of the atrial wall leads to atrial myopathy\nand electromechanical dissociation with high embolic risk.\nPatients with CA and history of AF should receive anticoagulation.\nThere is no evidence to support anticoagulation for patients\nin SR, yet.7,978 Amiodarone is the preferred antiarrhythmic\nagent.973\nTherapy of AL-CA is based on treatment of the underlying haema-\ntological problem with chemotherapy or autologous stem-cell\ntransplant.\nTTR stabilization and reduction of its production are the basis\nof TTR-CA treatment. Liver and/or cardiac transplantation can be\nconsidered only in end-stage disease of familial TTR-CA.\nTafamidis reduced all-cause mortality and CV hospitalizations in\ncardiac or non-cardiac biopsy-proven hereditary and wtTTR-CA,\nmainly in those patients with NYHA class I and II at baseline.\nFunctional improvement occurred within 6 months, whereas the\ndecrease in mortality took nearly 2 years to occur.979,980\nIntravenous patisiran, a small RNA interfering molecule, or subcu-\ntaneous inotersen, antisense oligonucleotide against TTR, may be\nconsidered\nin\nthose\npatients\nwith\ncombined\nhTTR-\npolyneuropathy and CA (Figure 21).981,982 Off-label use of diflu-\nnisal may be considered in wtTTR-CA in combination with a pro-\nton pump inhibitor.983\n14.7 Iron overload cardiomyopathy\nIron overload results either from genetically determined increased\nintestinal iron absorption in the context of hereditary haemochro-\nmatosis (primary iron overload) or from multiple blood transfu-\nsions required for the management of haematological conditions\nsuch as beta-thalassaemia (secondary iron overload).984 In iron\noverload, the iron binding capacity of transferrin is saturated and\nnon-transferrin-bound iron enters cardiomyocytes through L-\ntype calcium channels, causing oxidative myocardial damage.985\nTable 33\nCardiac magnetic resonance in patients with\nsuspected myocarditis955,956\nIndication\nIndicated at baseline, in all patients with clinical history þ ECG, elevated\ntroponin or echocardiographic abnormalities, and signiﬁcant CAD\nexcluded or unlikely.\nAdvised at follow-up in patients with persistent dysfunction at echocar-\ndiography, arrhythmias or ECG abnormalities.a\nMain ﬁndings\nAt baseline: T1-weighted (inﬂammation, injury) and T2-weighted (oedema)\nsequences, extracellular volume and LGE within 2 weeks after symptom\nonset.956,960\nAt follow up: LGE to evaluate the degree of scarring, T1 and T2 to identify\npersistent inﬂammation.a\nDiagnostic signiﬁcance\nAt least one T2-based criterion (global or regional increase of myocardial\nT2 relaxation time or an increased signal intensity in T2-weighted images),\nwith at least one T1-based criterion (increased myocardial T1, extracellu-\nlar volume, or LGE) in the acute phase.\nOnly one (i.e., T2-based or T1-based) marker may still support a diagnosis\nof acute myocardial inﬂammation in an appropriate clinical scenario, albeit\nwith less speciﬁcity in the acute phase.\nA negative T1/T2 scan does not exclude a still ongoing inﬂammatory proc-\ness in the chronic phase.a\nCAD = coronary artery disease; CMR = cardiac magnetic resonance; ECG = elec-\ntrocardiogram; LGE = late gadolinium enhancement.\naIt takes at least 3 months before CMR signs of oedema (secondary to inﬂamma-\ntion in the acute phase/baseline) disappear. At 6 months, T1 or T2 signs of\noedema should have disappeared if inﬂammation would be completely absent.\nStill, the absence of T1 or T2 oedema does not exclude chronic low-grade\ninﬂammation.\nTable 34\nTreatment and follow-up of acute myocarditis\nHF therapy should be started if LV systolic dysfunction is present at pre-\nsentation and should be continued for at least 6 months upon complete\nfunctional recovery (EF >50%).918,919\nImmunosuppression for at least 6\u000212 months is required in acute myo-\ncarditis with clinical or EMB evidence of auto-immune disease, including\ngiant cell myocarditis, vasculitis or sarcoidosis.98,917\u0002919,953,954,961\nImmunosuppression is not advised on a routine basis in acute myocarditis\nwithout clinical or EMB-based evidence of auto-immune disease.917 Initial\nempirical administration of i.v. corticosteroids may be taken into consid-\neration in cases of high suspicion of immune-mediated myocarditis espe-\ncially if complicated by acute HF, malignant arrhythmias and/or high\ndegree AV block.954,962\nIntense sporting activities should be avoided as long as symptoms, cardiac\nenzymes elevated or ECG/imaging abnormalities are present and last for\nat least 6 months since complete recovery.936\nYearly follow-up for at least 4 years, with an ECG and echocardiography,\nis needed as acute myocarditis may lead to DCM in up to 20% of\ncases.\nAV = atrio-ventricular;\nDCM = dilated\ncardiomyopathy;\nECG = electrocardio-\ngram; EF = ejection fraction; EMB = endomyocardial biopsy; HF = heart failure; i.v.\n= intravenous; LV = left ventricular.\nESC 2021\nESC 2021\n........................................................................\nESC Guidelines\n3685\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/36/3599/6358045 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n.....................................................................................................\nAdditional iron-induced complications, such as liver disease and\nendocrine abnormalities, further contribute to cardiac deteriora-\ntion.986,987 The end result is the development of iron overload\ncardiomyopathy (IOCM), which may have either a restrictive or a\ndilated phenotype, the former potentially evolving to the latter as\nthe disease advances.

Those with a\nLVEF between 41% and 49% are defined as ‘mildly reduced LVEF’\n(HFmrEF).\n(2)\nMeasurement of NPs and echocardiography have key roles in the\ndiagnosis of HF.\n(3)\nACE-I or ARNI, beta-blockers, MRA, and SGLT2 inhibitors are\nrecommended as cornerstone therapies for patients with HFrEF.\n(4)\nICDs are recommended in selected patients with HFrEF of an\nischaemic aetiology and should be considered in those with a non-\nischaemic aetiology.\n(5)\nCRT-P/D is recommended in those patients with HFrEF, in sinus\nrhythm, with a LBBB >_150 ms and should be considered in those\nwith a LBBB >_130\u0002149 ms or non-LBBB >_150 ms.\n(6)\nAdvanced HF strategies (heart transplantation/MCS) may be\nappropriate in selected patients.\n(7)\nACE-I/ARNI, beta-blockers, and MRA may be considered in\npatients with HFmrEF.\n(8)\nThe diagnosis of HFpEF requires objective evidence of cardiac\nstructural, or functional abnormalities as well as elevated plasma\nNP concentrations consistent with the presence of LV diastolic\ndysfunction and raised LV filling pressures. A diastolic stress test is\nrecommended when these markers are equivocal.\n(9)\nTo date, no treatment has been shown to reduce mortality and\nmorbidity in patients with HFpEF.\n(10)\nIt is recommended that all patients with HF be enrolled in a multi-\ndisciplinary HF-MP.\n(11)\nExercise is recommended for all patients who are able, to improve\nexercise capacity and QOL, and reduce HF hospitalization.\n(12)\nPatients with advanced HF refractory to medical/device therapy\nand who do not have absolute contraindications should be\nreferred for consideration of heart transplantation. MCS should\nalso be considered as BTT or DT in selected patients.\n(13)\nFour major clinical presentations of acute HF may occur: ADHF,\nacute pulmonary oedema, RV failure, and cardiogenic shock.\n(14)\nTreatment of acute HF is based on diuretics for congestion, ino-\ntropes, and short- term MCS for peripheral hypoperfusion.\n(15)\nPatients hospitalized for HF should be carefully evaluated to\nexclude persistent signs of congestion. Oral treatment should be\noptimized before discharge.\n(16)\nIn addition to oral anticoagulation, a strategy of rhythm control\nincluding catheter ablation should be considered in patients whose\nsymptoms and/or cardiac dysfunction are associated with AF.\n(17)\nSAVR or TAVI, as advised by the Heart Team, are recommended\nin patients with symptomatic severe aortic valve stenosis.\n(18)\nPatients with isolated significant SMR and COAPT criteria should\nbe considered for percutaneous edge-to-edge repair, whereas\nthose with SMR and CAD, who need revascularization, should be\nconsidered for surgery.\n(19)\nIt is recommended that patients with type II diabetes are treated\nwith SGLT2 inhibitors.\n(20)\nPatients should be periodically screened for anaemia and iron defi-\nciency and i.v. iron supplementation with ferric carboxymaltose\nshould be considered in symptomatic patients with LVEF <45%\nand iron deficiency, and in patients recently hospitalized for HF\nand with LVEF <_50% and iron deficiency.\nTable 36\nTreatment of adult congenital heart disease\nand heart failure in specialized centres\nACHD patients with chronic HF should be referred to specialized\ncentres.\nSpeciﬁc guidelines for medical treatment of chronic HF in ACHD are\nlacking, and practitioners should follow the current guidelines for medical\ntreatment of HF.

The methodology by which the ESC QIs\nare developed has been published997 and, to date, a suite of QIs for\nan initial tranche of CV conditions has been produced.998,999 To facili-\ntate quality improvement initiatives, the disease-specific ESC QIs are\nincluded in corresponding ESC Clinical Practice Guidelines.7,1000 This\nis further enhanced by way of their integration in the ESC registries,\nsuch as the EURObservational Research Programme (EORP) and the\nEuropean Unified Registries On Heart Care Evaluation and\nRandomized Trials (EuroHeart) project.1001\nFor patients with HF, QIs may help healthcare providers to simul-\ntaneously operationalize discrete guideline recommendations and\nenable the discrimination between missed opportunities and appro-\npriate care.

The methodology by which the ESC QIs\nare developed has been published997 and, to date, a suite of QIs for\nan initial tranche of CV conditions has been produced.998,999 To facili-\ntate quality improvement initiatives, the disease-specific ESC QIs are\nincluded in corresponding ESC Clinical Practice Guidelines.7,1000 This\nis further enhanced by way of their integration in the ESC registries,\nsuch as the EURObservational Research Programme (EORP) and the\nEuropean Unified Registries On Heart Care Evaluation and\nRandomized Trials (EuroHeart) project.1001\nFor patients with HF, QIs may help healthcare providers to simul-\ntaneously operationalize discrete guideline recommendations and\nenable the discrimination between missed opportunities and appro-\npriate care.
