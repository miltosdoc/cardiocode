for DVT, incidence rates range from 53\u0002162\nper 100 000 population.3,4 Cross-sectional data show that the\nincidence of VTE is almost eight times higher in individuals aged\n>_80 years than in the fifth decade of life.3 In parallel, longitudinal\nstudies have revealed a rising tendency in annual PE incidence\nrates4\u00027 over time. Together with the substantial hospital-\nassociated, preventable, and indirect annual expenditures for VTE\n(an estimated total of up to e8.5 billion in the European Union),8\nthese data demonstrate the importance of PE and DVT in ageing\npopulations in Europe and other areas of the world. They further\nsuggest that VTE will increasingly pose a burden on health systems\nworldwide in the years to come.\nPE may cause <_300 000 deaths per year in the US, ranking high\namong the causes of cardiovascular mortality.3 In six European\ncountries with a total population of 454.4 million, more than 370\n000 deaths were related to VTE in 2004, as estimated on the basis\nof an epidemiological model.9 Of these patients, 34% died sud-\ndenly or within a few hours of the acute event, before therapy\ncould be initiated or take effect. Of the other patients, death\nresulted from acute PE that was diagnosed after death in 59% and\nonly 7% of patients who died early were correctly diagnosed with\nPE before death.9\n2.2.3 Main new recommendations 2019\nDiagnosis\nA D-dimer test, using an age-adjusted cut-off or\nadapted to clinical probability, should be considered\nas an alternative to the ﬁxed cut-off level.\nIIa\nIf a positive proximal CUS is used to conﬁrm PE, risk\nassessment should be considered to guide\nmanagement.\nIIa\nV/Q SPECT may be considered for PE diagnosis.\nIIb\nRisk assessment\nAssessment of the RV by imaging or laboratory bio-\nmarkers should be considered, even in the presence\nof a low PESI or a sPESI of 0.\nIIa\nValidated scores combining clinical, imaging, and labo-\nratory prognostic factors may be considered to fur-\nther stratify PE severity.\nIIb\nTreatment in the acute phase\nWhen oral anticoagulation is initiated in a patient with\nPE who is eligible for a NOAC (apixaban, dabigatran,\nedoxaban, or rivaroxaban), a NOAC is the recom-\nmended form of anticoagulant treatment.\nI\nSet-up of multidisciplinary teams for management of\nhigh-risk and selected cases of intermediate-risk PE\nshould be considered, depending on the resources\nand expertise available in each hospital.\nIIa\nECMO may be considered, in combination with surgi-\ncal embolectomy or catheter-directed treatment, in\nrefractory circulatory collapse or cardiac arrest.\nIIb\nChronic treatment and prevention of recurrence\nIndeﬁnite treatment with a VKA is recommended for\npatients with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.\nI\nExtended anticoagulation should be considered for\npatients with no identiﬁable risk factor for the index\nPE event.\nIIa\nExtended anticoagulation should be considered for\npatients with a persistent risk factor other than anti-\nphospholipid antibody syndrome.\nIIa\nExtended anticoagulation should be considered for\npatients with a minor transient/reversible risk factor\nfor the index PE event.\nIIa\nA reduced dose of apixaban or rivaroxaban should be\nconsidered after the ﬁrst 6 months.\nIIa\nPE in cancer\nEdoxaban or rivaroxaban should be considered as an\nalternative to LMWH, with the exception of patients\nwith gastrointestinal cancer.\nIIa\nPE in pregnancy\nAmniotic ﬂuid embolism should be considered in a\npregnant or post-partum woman, with unexplained\nhaemodynamic instability or respiratory deteriora-\ntion, and disseminated intravascular coagulation.\nIIa\nContinued\nThrombolysis or surgical embolectomy should be\nconsidered for pregnant women with high-risk PE.\nIIa\nNOACs are not recommended during pregnancy or\nlactation.\nIII\nPost-PE care and long-term sequelae\nRoutine clinical evaluation is recommended 3\u00026\nmonths after acute PE.\nI\nAn integrated model of care is recommended after\nacute PE to ensure optimal transition from hospital to\nambulatory care.\nI\nIt is recommended that symptomatic patients with\nmismatched perfusion defects on a V/Q scan >3\nmonths after acute PE are referred to a pulmonary\nhypertension/CTEPH expert centre, taking into\naccount the results of echocardiography, natriu-\nretic peptide, and/or cardiopulmonary exercise\ntesting.\nI\nCPET = cardiopulmonary exercise testing; CTEPH = Chronic thromboembolic\npulmonary hypertension; CUS = compression ultrasonography; ECMO = extrac-\norporeal membrane oxygenation; LMWH = low-molecular weight heparin;\nNOAC(s) = non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant(s); PE = pulmonary\nembolism; PESI = Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index; RV = right ventricular;\nSPECT = single-photon emission computed tomography; sPESI = simpliﬁed\nPulmonary Embolism Severity Index; VKA(s) = vitamin K antagonist(s); V/Q =\nventilation/perfusion (lung scintigraphy).\nColoured columns indicate classes of recommendation (see Table 1 for colour\ncoding).\n550\nESC Guidelines\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/41/4/543/5556136 by guest on 14 January 2026",

However, there is also a tendency\ntowards overdiagnosis of (subsegmental or even non-existent) PE\nin the modern era,14 and this might in turn lead to a false drop in\ncase fatality rates by inflating the denominator, i.e. the total num-\nber of PE cases.\nFigure 1 summarizes the existing data on global trends in PE, high-\nlighting increasing incidence rates in parallel with decreasing case\nfatality rates over an \u000315 year period.\nIn children, studies have reported an annual incidence of VTE of\nbetween 53\u000257 per 100 000 among hospitalized patients,19,20 and\nbetween 1.4\u00024.9 per 100 000 in the community overall.21,22\n3.2 Predisposing factors\nThere is an extensive collection of predisposing environmental and\ngenetic factors for VTE; a list of predisposing (risk) factors is shown in\nTable 3. VTE is considered to be a consequence of the interaction\nbetween patient-related—usually permanent—risk factors and set-\nting-related—usually temporary—risk factors. Since categorization\nof temporary and permanent risk factors for VTE is important for\nassessing the risk of recurrence, and consequently for decision-\nmaking on chronic anticoagulation, it is discussed in more detail in sec-\ntion 8 of these Guidelines.\nMajor trauma, surgery, lower-limb fractures and joint replace-\nments, and spinal cord injury are strong provoking factors for\nVTE.23,24 Cancer is a well-recognized predisposing factor for VTE.\nThe risk of VTE varies with different types of cancer;25,26 pancre-\natic cancer, haematological malignancies, lung cancer, gastric can-\ncer, and brain cancer carry the highest risk.27,28 Moreover, cancer\nis a strong risk factor for all-cause mortality following an episode\nof VTE.29\nOestrogen-containing oral contraceptive agents are associated\nwith an elevated VTE risk, and contraceptive use is the most frequent\nVTE risk factor in women of reproductive age.30\u000232 More specifically,\ncombined oral contraceptives (containing both an oestrogen and a\nprogestogen) are associated with an approximately two- to six-fold\nincrease in VTE risk over baseline.32,33 In general, the absolute VTE\nrisk remains low in the majority of the >100 million combined oral\ncontraceptive users worldwide;34 however, VTE risk factors, includ-\ning severe inherited thrombophilia (discussed in section 8),35 increase\nthis risk. Third-generation combined oral contraceptives, containing\nprogestogens such as desogestrel or gestodene, are associated with a\nhigher VTE risk than the second-generation combined oral contra-\nceptives, which contain progestogens such as levonorgestrel or nor-\ngestrel.36,37 On the other hand, hormone-releasing intrauterine\ndevices and some progesterone-only pills (used at contraceptive\ndoses) are not associated with a significant increase in VTE risk;33,38\nconsequently, and following counselling and full risk assessment,\nthese options are often proposed to women with a personal or\nstrong family history of VTE.\nIn post-menopausal women who receive hormone replacement\ntherapy, the risk of VTE varies widely depending on the formulation\nused.39\nInfection is a common trigger for VTE.23,40,41 Blood transfusion\nand erythropoiesis-stimulating agents are also associated with an\nincreased risk of VTE.23,42\nIn children, PE is usually associated with DVT and is rarely unpro-\nvoked. Serious chronic medical conditions and central venous lines\nare considered likely triggers of PE.43\nVTE may be viewed as part of the cardiovascular disease con-\ntinuum, and common risk factors—such as cigarette smoking,\nobesity, hypercholesterolaemia, hypertension, and diabetes\n©ESC 2019\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n1997\n1999\n2001\n2003\n2005\n2007\n2009\n2011\n2013\n0\n16\n18\n20\n22\n24\n26\n04\n02\n06\n08\n10\n12\n14\n1997\n1999\n2001\n2003\n2005\n2007\n2009\n2011\n2013\nChinaa, 17\nItalya, 6\nSpaina, 5\nUSb, 14\nUSa, 16\nUSa,11\nUSa, 14\nUSb,14\nUSa, 14\nAustraliaa, 15\nItalya, 6\nSpaina, 5\nYear\nYear\nUSb, 16\nAnnual Incidence Rate\n(number of PE diagnoses / 100.000 inhabitants)\nCase Finality Rate\n(number of in-hospital deaths / 100 PE diagnoses; %)\nFigure 1 Trends in annual incidence rates (left panel) and case fatality rates (right panel) of pulmonary embolism around the world, based on data\nretrieved from various references.5,6,11,14\u000217 Reproduced with permission from JACC 2016;67:976-90.

Right\nventricular (RV) failure due to acute pressure overload is consid-\nered the primary cause of death in severe PE. Pulmonary artery\npressure (PAP) increases if >30\u000250% of the total cross-sectional\narea of the pulmonary arterial bed is occluded by thromboem-\nboli.57 PE-induced vasoconstriction, mediated by the release of\nthromboxane A2 and serotonin, contributes to the initial increase\nin pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) after PE.58 Anatomical\nobstruction and hypoxic vasoconstriction in the affected lung area\nlead to an increase in PVR, and a proportional decrease in arterial\ncompliance.59\nThe abrupt increase in PVR results in RV dilation, which alters the\ncontractile properties of the RV myocardium via the Frank\u0002Starling\nmechanism. The increase in RV pressure and volume leads to an\nincrease in wall tension and myocyte stretch. The contraction time of\nthe RV is prolonged, while neurohumoral activation leads to ino-\ntropic and chronotropic stimulation. Together with systemic vaso-\nconstriction,\nthese\ncompensatory\nmechanisms\nincrease\nPAP,\nimproving flow through the obstructed pulmonary vascular bed and\nthus temporarily stabilizing systemic blood pressure (BP). However,\nthe\nextent\nof\nimmediate\nadaptation\nis\nlimited,\nas\na\nnon-\npreconditioned, thin-walled RV is unable to generate a mean PAP\n>40 mmHg.\nProlongation of RV contraction time into early diastole in the left\nventricle (LV) leads to leftward bowing of the interventricular sep-\ntum.60 The desynchronization of the ventricles may be exacerbated\nby the development of right bundle branch block.

Right\nventricular (RV) failure due to acute pressure overload is consid-\nered the primary cause of death in severe PE. Pulmonary artery\npressure (PAP) increases if >30\u000250% of the total cross-sectional\narea of the pulmonary arterial bed is occluded by thromboem-\nboli.57 PE-induced vasoconstriction, mediated by the release of\nthromboxane A2 and serotonin, contributes to the initial increase\nin pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) after PE.58 Anatomical\nobstruction and hypoxic vasoconstriction in the affected lung area\nlead to an increase in PVR, and a proportional decrease in arterial\ncompliance.59\nThe abrupt increase in PVR results in RV dilation, which alters the\ncontractile properties of the RV myocardium via the Frank\u0002Starling\nmechanism. The increase in RV pressure and volume leads to an\nincrease in wall tension and myocyte stretch. The contraction time of\nthe RV is prolonged, while neurohumoral activation leads to ino-\ntropic and chronotropic stimulation. Together with systemic vaso-\nconstriction,\nthese\ncompensatory\nmechanisms\nincrease\nPAP,\nimproving flow through the obstructed pulmonary vascular bed and\nthus temporarily stabilizing systemic blood pressure (BP). However,\nthe\nextent\nof\nimmediate\nadaptation\nis\nlimited,\nas\na\nnon-\npreconditioned, thin-walled RV is unable to generate a mean PAP\n>40 mmHg.\nProlongation of RV contraction time into early diastole in the left\nventricle (LV) leads to leftward bowing of the interventricular sep-\ntum.60 The desynchronization of the ventricles may be exacerbated\nby the development of right bundle branch block. As a result, LV fill-\ning is impeded in early diastole, and this may lead to a reduction in\nthe cardiac output (CO), and contribute to systemic hypotension\nand haemodynamic instability.61\nAs described above, excessive neurohumoral activation in PE can\nbe the result of both abnormal RV wall tension and circulatory shock.\nThe finding of massive infiltrates of inflammatory cells in the RV myo-\ncardia of patients who died within 48 h of acute PE may be explained\nby high levels of epinephrine released as a result of the PE-induced\n‘myocarditis’.62 This inflammatory response might explain the secon-\ndary haemodynamic destabilization that sometimes occurs 24\u000248 h\nafter acute PE, although early recurrence of PE may be an alternative\nexplanation in some of these cases.\nFinally, the association between elevated circulating levels of bio-\nmarkers of myocardial injury and an adverse early outcome indicates\nthat RV ischaemia is of pathophysiological significance in the acute\nphase of PE.63,64 Although RV infarction is uncommon after PE, it is\nlikely that the imbalance between oxygen supply and demand can\nresult in damage to cardiomyocytes, and further reduce contractile\nforces.

However, the absence of haemodynamic insta-\nbility does not exclude beginning (and possibly progressing) RV dys-\nfunction, and thus an elevated PE-related early risk. In this large\npopulation, further assessment (outlined in sections 5 and 7) is neces-\nsary to determine the level of risk and adjust management decisions\naccordingly.\n4 Diagnosis\nThe increased awareness of venous thromboembolic disease and the\never-increasing availability of non-invasive imaging tests, mainly com-\nputed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiography (CTPA), have gen-\nerated a tendency for clinicians to suspect and initiate a diagnostic\nworkup for PE more frequently than in the past. This changing atti-\ntude is illustrated by the rates of PE confirmation among patients\nundergoing diagnostic workup: these were as low as 5% in recent\nNorth American diagnostic studies, in sharp contrast to the approxi-\nmately 50% prevalence reported back in the early 1980s.71\nTherefore, it is critical that, when evaluating non-invasive diagnostic\nstrategies for PE in the modern era, it is ensured that they are capable\nof safely excluding PE in contemporary patient populations with a\nrather low pre-test probability of the disease.72 Conversely, a posi-\ntive test should have an adequate specificity to set the indication for\nanticoagulant treatment.\n4.1 Clinical presentation\nThe clinical signs and symptoms of acute PE are non-specific. In most\ncases, PE is suspected in a patient with dyspnoea, chest pain, pre-\nsyncope or syncope, or haemoptysis.73\u000275 Haemodynamic instability\nis a rare but important form of clinical presentation, as it indicates\ncentral or extensive PE with severely reduced haemodynamic\nreserve. Syncope may occur, and is associated with a higher preva-\nlence of haemodynamic instability and RV dysfunction.76 Conversely,\nand according to the results of a recent study, acute PE may be a fre-\nquent finding in patients presenting with syncope (17%), even in the\npresence of an alternative explanation.77\nIn some cases, PE may be asymptomatic or discovered incidentally\nduring diagnostic workup for another disease.\nDyspnoea may be acute and severe in central PE; in small periph-\neral PE, it is often mild and may be transient. In patients with pre-\nexisting heart failure or pulmonary disease, worsening dyspnoea may\nbe the only symptom indicative of PE. Chest pain is a frequent symp-\ntom of PE and is usually caused by pleural irritation due to distal\nemboli causing pulmonary infarction.78 In central PE, chest pain may\nhave a typical angina character, possibly reflecting RV ischaemia, and\nrequiring differential diagnosis from an acute coronary syndrome or\naortic dissection.\nIn addition to symptoms, knowledge of the predisposing factors\nfor VTE is important in determining the clinical probability of the\ndisease, which increases with the number of predisposing factors\npresent; however, in 40% of patients with PE, no predisposing fac-\ntors are found.79 Hypoxaemia is frequent, but <_40% of patients\nhave normal arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) and 20% have a\nnormal alveolar\u0002arterial oxygen gradient.80,81 Hypocapnia is also\noften present. A chest X-ray is frequently abnormal and, although\nits findings are usually non-specific in PE, it may be useful for\nexcluding\nother\ncauses\nof\ndyspnoea\nor\nchest\npain.82\nElectrocardiographic changes indicative of RV strain—such as\ninversion of T waves in leads V1\u0002V4, a QR pattern in V1, a\nS1Q3T3 pattern, and incomplete or complete right bundle branch\nblock—are usually found in more severe cases of PE;83 in milder\ncases, the only abnormality may be sinus tachycardia, present in\n40% of patients. Finally, atrial arrhythmias, most frequently atrial\nfibrillation, may be associated with acute PE.\n4.2 Assessment of clinical (pre-test)\nprobability\nThe combination of symptoms and clinical findings with the presence\nof predisposing factors for VTE allows the classification of patients\nwith suspected PE into distinct categories of clinical or pre-test proba-\nbility, which correspond to an increasing actual prevalence of con-\nfirmed PE. This pre-test assessment can be done either by implicit\n(empirical) clinical judgement or by using prediction rules. As the\npost-test (i.e. after an imaging test) probability of PE depends not only\non the characteristics of the diagnostic test itself but also on the pre-\ntest probability, this is a key step in all diagnostic algorithms for PE.\nThe value of empirical clinical judgement has been confirmed in\nseveral\nlarge\nseries.84,85\nClinical\njudgement\nusually\nincludes\n................................................\nTable 5\nThe revised Geneva clinical prediction rule for\npulmonary embolism\nItems\nClinical decision rule points\nOriginal\nversion91\nSimplified\nversion87\nPrevious PE or DVT\n3\n1\nHeart rate\n75\u000294 b.p.m.\n3\n1\n>_95 b.p.m.\n5\n2\nSurgery or fracture within the\npast month\n2\n1\nHaemoptysis\n2\n1\nActive cancer\n2\n1\nUnilateral lower-limb pain\n3\n1\nPain on lower-limb deep venous\npalpation and unilateral oedema\n4\n1\nAge >65 years\n1\n1\nClinical probability\nThree-level score\nLow\n0\u00023\n0\u00021\nIntermediate\n4\u000210\n2\u00024\nHigh\n>_11\n>_5\nTwo-level score\nPE-unlikely\n0\u00025\n0\u00022\nPE-likely\n>_6\n>_3\nb.p.m. = beats per minute; DVT = deep vein thrombosis; PE = pulmonary\nembolism.\n554\nESC Guidelines\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/41/4/543/5556136 by guest on 14 January 2026",

In this large\npopulation, further assessment (outlined in sections 5 and 7) is neces-\nsary to determine the level of risk and adjust management decisions\naccordingly.\n4 Diagnosis\nThe increased awareness of venous thromboembolic disease and the\never-increasing availability of non-invasive imaging tests, mainly com-\nputed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiography (CTPA), have gen-\nerated a tendency for clinicians to suspect and initiate a diagnostic\nworkup for PE more frequently than in the past. This changing atti-\ntude is illustrated by the rates of PE confirmation among patients\nundergoing diagnostic workup: these were as low as 5% in recent\nNorth American diagnostic studies, in sharp contrast to the approxi-\nmately 50% prevalence reported back in the early 1980s.71\nTherefore, it is critical that, when evaluating non-invasive diagnostic\nstrategies for PE in the modern era, it is ensured that they are capable\nof safely excluding PE in contemporary patient populations with a\nrather low pre-test probability of the disease.72 Conversely, a posi-\ntive test should have an adequate specificity to set the indication for\nanticoagulant treatment.\n4.1 Clinical presentation\nThe clinical signs and symptoms of acute PE are non-specific. In most\ncases, PE is suspected in a patient with dyspnoea, chest pain, pre-\nsyncope or syncope, or haemoptysis.73\u000275 Haemodynamic instability\nis a rare but important form of clinical presentation, as it indicates\ncentral or extensive PE with severely reduced haemodynamic\nreserve. Syncope may occur, and is associated with a higher preva-\nlence of haemodynamic instability and RV dysfunction.76 Conversely,\nand according to the results of a recent study, acute PE may be a fre-\nquent finding in patients presenting with syncope (17%), even in the\npresence of an alternative explanation.77\nIn some cases, PE may be asymptomatic or discovered incidentally\nduring diagnostic workup for another disease.\nDyspnoea may be acute and severe in central PE; in small periph-\neral PE, it is often mild and may be transient. In patients with pre-\nexisting heart failure or pulmonary disease, worsening dyspnoea may\nbe the only symptom indicative of PE. Chest pain is a frequent symp-\ntom of PE and is usually caused by pleural irritation due to distal\nemboli causing pulmonary infarction.78 In central PE, chest pain may\nhave a typical angina character, possibly reflecting RV ischaemia, and\nrequiring differential diagnosis from an acute coronary syndrome or\naortic dissection.\nIn addition to symptoms, knowledge of the predisposing factors\nfor VTE is important in determining the clinical probability of the\ndisease, which increases with the number of predisposing factors\npresent; however, in 40% of patients with PE, no predisposing fac-\ntors are found.79 Hypoxaemia is frequent, but <_40% of patients\nhave normal arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) and 20% have a\nnormal alveolar\u0002arterial oxygen gradient.80,81 Hypocapnia is also\noften present. A chest X-ray is frequently abnormal and, although\nits findings are usually non-specific in PE, it may be useful for\nexcluding\nother\ncauses\nof\ndyspnoea\nor\nchest\npain.82\nElectrocardiographic changes indicative of RV strain—such as\ninversion of T waves in leads V1\u0002V4, a QR pattern in V1, a\nS1Q3T3 pattern, and incomplete or complete right bundle branch\nblock—are usually found in more severe cases of PE;83 in milder\ncases, the only abnormality may be sinus tachycardia, present in\n40% of patients. Finally, atrial arrhythmias, most frequently atrial\nfibrillation, may be associated with acute PE.\n4.2 Assessment of clinical (pre-test)\nprobability\nThe combination of symptoms and clinical findings with the presence\nof predisposing factors for VTE allows the classification of patients\nwith suspected PE into distinct categories of clinical or pre-test proba-\nbility, which correspond to an increasing actual prevalence of con-\nfirmed PE. This pre-test assessment can be done either by implicit\n(empirical) clinical judgement or by using prediction rules. As the\npost-test (i.e. after an imaging test) probability of PE depends not only\non the characteristics of the diagnostic test itself but also on the pre-\ntest probability, this is a key step in all diagnostic algorithms for PE.\nThe value of empirical clinical judgement has been confirmed in\nseveral\nlarge\nseries.84,85\nClinical\njudgement\nusually\nincludes\n................................................\nTable 5\nThe revised Geneva clinical prediction rule for\npulmonary embolism\nItems\nClinical decision rule points\nOriginal\nversion91\nSimplified\nversion87\nPrevious PE or DVT\n3\n1\nHeart rate\n75\u000294 b.p.m.\n3\n1\n>_95 b.p.m.\n5\n2\nSurgery or fracture within the\npast month\n2\n1\nHaemoptysis\n2\n1\nActive cancer\n2\n1\nUnilateral lower-limb pain\n3\n1\nPain on lower-limb deep venous\npalpation and unilateral oedema\n4\n1\nAge >65 years\n1\n1\nClinical probability\nThree-level score\nLow\n0\u00023\n0\u00021\nIntermediate\n4\u000210\n2\u00024\nHigh\n>_11\n>_5\nTwo-level score\nPE-unlikely\n0\u00025\n0\u00022\nPE-likely\n>_6\n>_3\nb.p.m. = beats per minute; DVT = deep vein thrombosis; PE = pulmonary\nembolism.\n554\nESC Guidelines\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/41/4/543/5556136 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n.............................................................................................................................................................................\ncommonplace tests such as chest X-rays and electrocardiograms for\ndifferential diagnosis. However, as clinical judgement lacks standard-\nization, several explicit clinical prediction rules have been developed.\nOf these, the most frequently used prediction rules are the revised\nGeneva rule (Table 5) and the Wells rule (see Supplementary Data\nTable 1).86 Both prediction rules have been simplified in an attempt\nto increase their adoption into clinical practice;87,88 the simplified ver-\nsions have been externally validated.89,90\nRegardless of the score used, the proportion of patients with con-\nfirmed PE can be expected to be \u000310% in the low-probability category,\n30% in the moderate-probability category, and 65% in the high-\nprobability category.92 When the two-level classification is used, the\nproportion of patients with confirmed PE is \u000312% in the PE-unlikely cat-\negory and 30% in the PE-likely category.92 A direct prospective compar-\nison of these rules confirmed a similar diagnostic performance.89\n4.3 Avoiding overuse of diagnostic tests\nfor pulmonary embolism\nSearching for PE in every patient with dyspnoea or chest pain may\nlead to high costs and complications of unnecessary tests. The\nPulmonary Embolism Rule-out Criteria (PERC) were developed for\nemergency department patients with the purpose of selecting, on\nclinical grounds, patients whose likelihood of having PE is so low that\ndiagnostic workup should not even be initiated.93 They comprise\neight clinical variables significantly associated with an absence of PE:\nage < 50 years; pulse < 100 beats per minute; SaO2 >94%; no unilat-\neral leg swelling; no haemoptysis; no recent trauma or surgery; no\nhistory of VTE; and no oral hormone use. The results of a prospec-\ntive validation study,94 and those of a randomized non-inferiority\nmanagement study,95 suggested safe exclusion of PE in patients with\nlow clinical probability who, in addition, met all criteria of the PERC\nrule. However, the low overall prevalence of PE in these studies94,95\ndoes not support the generalizability of the results.\n4.4 D-dimer testing\nD-dimer levels are elevated in plasma in the presence of acute throm-\nbosis because of simultaneous activation of coagulation and fibrinoly-\nsis. The negative predictive value of D-dimer testing is high, and a\nnormal D-dimer level renders acute PE or DVT unlikely. On the\nother hand, the positive predictive value of elevated D-dimer levels is\nlow and D-dimer testing is not useful for confirmation of PE. D-dimer\nis also more frequently elevated in patients with cancer,96,97 in hospi-\ntalized patients,89,98 in severe infection or inflammatory disease, and\nduring pregnancy.99,100 Accordingly, the number of patients in whom\nD-dimer must be measured to exclude one PE (number needed to\ntest) rises from 3 in the general population of an emergency depart-\nment to >_10 in the specific situations listed above.\nAs a number of D-dimer assays are available, clinicians should\nbecome aware of the diagnostic performance of the test used in their\nown hospital. The quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay\n(ELISA) or ELISA-derived assays have a diagnostic sensitivity of >_95%,\nand can be used to exclude PE in patients with either low or intermedi-\nate pre-test probability. In the emergency department, a negative ELISA\nD-dimer can, in combination with clinical probability, exclude the dis-\nease without further testing in \u000330% of patients with suspected\nPE.101\u0002103 Outcome studies have shown that the 3 month thrombo-\nembolic risk was <1% in patients with low or intermediate clinical prob-\nability who were left untreated on the basis of a negative test result.104\n4.4.1 Age-adjusted D-dimer cut-offs\nThe specificity of D-dimer in suspected PE decreases steadily with age\nto \u000310% in patients >80 years of age.105 The use of age-adjusted cut-\noffs may improve the performance of D-dimer testing in the elderly. A\nmultinational prospective management study evaluated a previously\nvalidated age-adjusted cut-off (age \u0004 10 mg/L, for patients aged >50\nyears) in a cohort of 3346 patients.106 Patients with a normal age-\nadjusted D-dimer value did not undergo CTPA; they were left\nuntreated and followed for a 3 month period. Among the 766 patients\nwho were >_75 years of age, 673 had a non-high clinical probability.\nUse of the age-adjusted (instead of the ‘standard’ 500 mg/L) D-dimer\ncut-off increased the number of patients in whom PE could be\nexcluded from 6.4 to 30%, without additional false-negative findings.106\n4.4.2 D-dimer cut-offs adapted to clinical probability\nA prospective management trial used the ‘YEARS’ clinical decision\nrule, which consists of three clinical items of the Wells score (see\nSupplementary Data Table 1)—namely signs of DVT, haemoptysis,\nand PE more likely than an alternative diagnosis—plus D-dimer con-\ncentrations.107 PE was considered to be excluded in patients without\nclinical items and D-dimer levels <1000 ng/mL, or in patients with\none or more clinical items and D-dimer levels <500 ng/mL. All other\npatients underwent CTPA. Of the 2946 patients (85%) in whom PE\nwas ruled out at baseline and who were left untreated, 18 [0.61%,\n95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36\u00020.96%] were diagnosed with\nsymptomatic VTE during the 3 month follow-up. CTPA was avoided\nin 48% of the included patients using this algorithm, compared to\n34% if the Wells rule and a fixed D-dimer threshold of 500 ng/mL\nwould have been applied.107\n4.4.3 Point-of-care D-dimer assays\nIn certain situations, notably in community or primary care medicine,\n‘on-the-spot’ D-dimer testing may have advantages over referring a\npatient to a central laboratory for D-dimer testing. This may particu-\nlarly apply to remote areas where access to healthcare is lim-\nited.108,109 However, point-of-care assays have a lower sensitivity and\nnegative predictive value compared with laboratory-based D-dimer\ntests. In a systematic review and meta-analysis, sensitivity of point-of-\ncare D-dimer assays was 88% (95% CI 83\u000292%) whereas conven-\ntional laboratory-based D-dimer testing had a sensitivity of at least\n95%.110 As a result, point-of-care D-dimer assays should only be\nused in patients with a low pre-test probability. In these situations, PE\ncould be ruled out in 46% of patients with suspected PE without pro-\nceeding to imaging tests (with a failure rate of 1.5%), as suggested by a\nprospective study in Dutch primary care.111\n4.5 Computed tomographic pulmonary\nangiography\nMultidetector CTPA is the method of choice for imaging the pulmo-\nnary vasculature in patients with suspected PE. It allows adequate visu-\nalization of the pulmonary arteries down to the subsegmental\nlevel.112\u0002114 The Prospective Investigation On Pulmonary Embolism\nDiagnosis (PIOPED) II study observed a sensitivity of 83% and a\nESC Guidelines\n555\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/41/4/543/5556136 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n.............................................................\nspecificity of 96% for (mainly four-detector) CTPA in PE diagnosis.115\nPIOPED II also highlighted the influence of pre-test clinical probability\non the predictive value of multidetector CTPA. In patients with a low\nor intermediate clinical probability of PE, a negative CTPA had a high\nnegative predictive value for PE (96 and 89%, respectively), but its neg-\native predictive value was only 60% if the pre-test probability was high.\nConversely, the positive predictive value of a positive CTPA was high\n(92\u000296%) in patients with an intermediate or high clinical probability,\nbut much lower (58%) in patients with a low pre-test likelihood of\nPE.115 Therefore, clinicians should consider further testing in case of\ndiscordance between clinical judgement and the CTPA result.\nSeveral studies have provided evidence in favour of CTPA as a\nstand-alone imaging test for excluding PE. Taken together, the avail-\nable data suggest that a negative CTPA result is an adequate criterion\nfor the exclusion of PE in patients with low or intermediate clinical\nprobability of PE. On the other hand, it remains controversial\nwhether patients with a negative CTPA and a high clinical probability\nshould be further investigated.\nChronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is a\npotentially fatal late sequela of PE, but pre-existing CTEPH should not\nbe missed in patients investigated for suspected acute PE. Signs of pre-\nexisting CTEPH on CTPA are listed in Supplementary Data Table 2;\nthe diagnosis and management of CTEPH is discussed in section 10.\nThe major strengths, weaknesses/limitations, and radiation issues\nrelated to the use of CTPA in the diagnosis of PE are summarized in\nTable 6.\n4.6 Lung scintigraphy\nThe planar ventilation/perfusion [V/Q (lung scintigraphy)] scan is an\nestablished diagnostic test for suspected PE. Perfusion scans are com-\nbined with ventilation studies, for which multiple tracers such as\nxenon-133 gas, krypton-81 gas, technetium-99m-labelled aerosols,\nor technetium-99m-labelled carbon microparticles (Technegas) can\nbe used. The purpose of the ventilation scan is to increase specificity:\nin acute PE, ventilation is expected to be normal in hypoperfused seg-\nments (mismatched). Being a lower-radiation and contrast medium-\nsparing procedure, the V/Q scan may preferentially be applied in out-\npatients with a low clinical probability and a normal chest X-ray, in\nyoung (particularly female) patients, in pregnant women, in patients\nTable 6\nImaging tests for diagnosis of pulmonary embolism\nStrengths\nWeaknesses/limitations\nRadiation issuesa\nCTPA\n• Readily available around the clock in most\ncentres\n• Excellent accuracy\n• Strong validation in prospective manage-\nment outcome studies\n• Low rate of inconclusive results (3\u00025%)\n• May provide alternative diagnosis if PE\nexcluded\n• Short acquisition time\n• Radiation exposure\n• Exposure to iodine contrast:\n\u0002\nlimited use in iodine allergy and\nhyperthyroidism\n\u0002\nrisks in pregnant and breastfeeding\nwomen\n\u0002\ncontraindicated in severe renal failure\n• Tendency to overuse because of easy\naccessibility\n• Clinical relevance of CTPA diagnosis of\nsubsegmental PE unknown\n• Radiation effective dose 3\u000210\nmSvb\n• Signiﬁcant radiation exposure\nto young female breast tissue\nPlanar\nV/Q scan\n• Almost no contraindications\n• Relatively inexpensive\n• Strong validation in prospective manage-\nment outcome studies\n• Not readily available in all centres\n• Interobserver variability in interpretation\n• Results reported as likelihood ratios\n• Inconclusive in 50% of cases\n• Cannot provide alternative diagnosis if PE\nexcluded\n• Lower radiation than CTPA,\neffective dose \u00032 mSvb\nV/Q SPECT\n• Almost no contraindications\n• Lowest rate of non-diagnostic tests (<3%)\n• High accuracy according to available data\n• Binary interpretation (‘PE’ vs. ‘no PE’)\n• Variability of techniques\n• Variability of diagnostic criteria\n• Cannot provide alternative diagnosis if PE\nexcluded\n• No validation in prospective management\noutcome studies\n• Lower radiation than CTPA,\neffective dose \u00032 mSvb\nPulmonary\nangiography\n• Historical gold standard\n• Invasive procedure\n• Not readily available in all centres\n• Highest radiation, effective\ndose 10\u000220 mSvb\nCTPA = computed tomographic pulmonary angiography; mGy = milligray; mSv = millisieverts; PE = pulmonary embolism; SPECT = single-photon emission computed tomogra-\nphy; V/Q = ventilation/perfusion (lung scintigraphy).\naIn this section, effective radiation dose is expressed in mSv [dose in mSv = absorbed dose in mGy \u0004 radiation weighting factor (1.0 for X-rays) \u0004 tissue weighting factor].

This was con-\nfirmed by a randomized trial comparing the V/Q scan with CTPA.122\nAn analysis from the PIOPED II study suggested that a high-\nprobability V/Q scan could confirm PE, although other sources sug-\ngest that the positive predictive value of a high-probability lung scan is\nnot sufficient to confirm PE in patients with a low clinical\nprobability.123,124\nPerforming only a perfusion scan might be acceptable in patients\nwith a normal chest X-ray; any perfusion defect in this situation\nwould be considered a mismatch. The high frequency of non-\ndiagnostic scans is a limitation because they indicate the necessity for\nfurther diagnostic testing. Various strategies to overcome this prob-\nlem have been proposed, notably the incorporation of clinical proba-\nbility. Although the use of perfusion scanning and chest X-ray with\nthe Prospective Investigative Study of Acute Pulmonary Embolism\nDiagnosis (PISAPED) criteria may be associated with a low rate of\ninconclusive results, the sensitivity appears too low to exclude PE\nand thus this approach may be less safe than CTPA.123,125\nSeveral studies suggest that data acquisition in single-photon emis-\nsion CT (SPECT) imaging, with or without low-dose CT, may\ndecrease the proportion of non-diagnostic scans to as low as\n0\u00025%.121,126\u0002128 However, most studies reporting on the accuracy\nof SPECT are limited by their retrospective design129,130 or the inclu-\nsion of SPECT itself in the reference standard,127 and only one study\nused a validated diagnostic algorithm.131 The diagnostic criteria for\nSPECT also varied; most studies defined PE as one or two subseg-\nmental perfusion defects without ventilation defects, but these crite-\nria are infrequently used in clinical practice. In addition, the optimal\nscanning technique (perfusion SPECT, V/Q SPECT, perfusion SPECT\nwith non-enhanced CT, or V/Q SPECT with non-enhanced CT)\nremains to be defined. Finally, few outcome studies are available, and\nwith incomplete follow-up.132 Large-scale prospective studies are\nneeded to validate SPECT techniques.\nThe major strengths, weaknesses/limitations, and radiation issues\nrelated to the use of V/Q scan and V/Q SPECT in the diagnosis of PE\nare summarized in Table 6.\n4.7 Pulmonary angiography\nFor several decades, pulmonary angiography was the ‘gold standard’\nfor the diagnosis or exclusion of acute PE, but it is now rarely per-\nformed as less-invasive CTPA offers similar diagnostic accuracy.133\nThe diagnosis of acute PE is based on direct evidence of a thrombus in\ntwo projections, either as a filling defect or as amputation of a pulmo-\nnary arterial branch.134 Thrombi as small as 1\u00022 mm within the sub-\nsegmental arteries can be visualized by digital subtraction angiography,\nbut there is substantial interobserver variability at this level.135,136\nPulmonary angiography is not free of risk. In a study of 1111\npatients, procedure-related mortality was 0.5%, major non-fatal\ncomplications occurred in 1%, and minor complications in 5%.137\nThe majority of deaths occurred in patients with haemodynamic\ncompromise or respiratory failure. The amount of contrast agent\nshould be reduced and non-selective injections avoided in patients\nwith haemodynamic compromise.138\nThe major strengths, weaknesses/limitations, and radiation issues\nrelated to the use of pulmonary angiography in the diagnosis of PE\nare summarized in Table 6.\n4.8 Magnetic resonance angiography\nMagnetic resonance angiography (MRA) has been evaluated for sev-\neral years regarding suspected PE. However, the results of large-scale\nstudies139,140 show that this technique, although promising, is not yet\nready for clinical practice due to its low sensitivity, the high propor-\ntion of inconclusive MRA scans, and its low availability in most emer-\ngency settings. The hypothesis that a negative MRA, combined with\nthe absence of proximal DVT on compression ultrasonography\n(CUS), may safely rule out clinically significant PE is currently being\ninvestigated\nin\nan\nongoing\nmulticentre\noutcome\nstudy\n[Clinicaltrials.gov National Clinical Trial (NCT) number 02059551].\n4.9 Echocardiography\nAcute PE may lead to RV pressure overload and dysfunction, which\ncan be detected by echocardiography. Given the peculiar geometry\nof the RV, there is no individual echocardiographic parameter that\nprovides fast and reliable information on RV size or function. This is\nwhy echocardiographic criteria for the diagnosis of PE have differed\nbetween studies. Because of the reported negative predictive value\nof 40\u000250%, a negative result cannot exclude PE.124,142,143 On the\nother hand, signs of RV overload or dysfunction may also be found in\nthe absence of acute PE, and may be due to concomitant cardiac or\nrespiratory disease.144\nEchocardiographic findings of RV overload and/or dysfunction are\ngraphically presented in Figure 3. RV dilation is found in >_25% of\npatients with PE on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and is use-\nful for risk stratification of the disease.145 More specific echocardio-\ngraphic findings were reported to retain a high positive predictive\nvalue for PE even in the presence of pre-existing cardiorespiratory\ndisease. Thus, the combination of a pulmonary ejection acceleration\ntime (measured in the RV outflow tract) <60 ms with a peak systolic\ntricuspid valve gradient <60 mmHg (‘60/60’ sign), or with depressed\ncontractility of the RV free wall compared to the ‘echocardiographic’\nRV apex (McConnell sign), is suggestive of PE.146 However, these\nfindings are present in only \u000312 and 20% of unselected PE patients,\nrespectively.145 Detection of echocardiographic signs of RV pressure\noverload helps to distinguish acute PE from RV free wall hypokinesia\nor akinesia due to RV infarction, which may mimic the McConnell\nsign.147 It should be noted that in \u000310% of PE patients, echocardiog-\nraphy can show potentially misleading incidental findings such as sig-\nnificant LV systolic dysfunction or valvular heart disease.145\nDecreased tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) may\nalso be present in PE patients.148,149 Echocardiographic parameters\nof RV function derived from Doppler tissue imaging and wall strain\nassessment may also be affected by the presence of acute PE\n(Figure 3). However, they probably have low sensitivity as stand-alone\nfindings, as they were reported to be normal in haemodynamically\nstable patients despite the presence of PE.150,151\nESC Guidelines\n557\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/41/4/543/5556136 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n..................................................................................\nEchocardiographic examination is not mandatory as part of the\nroutine diagnostic workup in haemodynamically stable patients with\nsuspected PE,124 although it may be useful in the differential diagnosis\nof acute dyspnoea. This is in contrast to suspected high-risk PE, in\nwhich the absence of echocardiographic signs of RV overload or dys-\nfunction practically excludes PE as the cause of haemodynamic insta-\nbility. In the latter case, echocardiography may be of further help in\nthe differential diagnosis of the cause of shock, by detecting pericar-\ndial tamponade, acute valvular dysfunction, severe global or regional\nLV dysfunction, aortic dissection, or hypovolaemia.152 Conversely, in\na haemodynamically compromised patient with suspected PE,\nunequivocal signs of RV pressure overload, especially with more spe-\ncific echocardiographic findings (60/60 sign, McConnell sign, or right-\nheart thrombi), justify emergency reperfusion treatment for PE if\nimmediate CT angiography is not feasible in a patient with high clinical\nprobability\nand\nno\nother\nobvious\ncauses\nfor\nRV\npressure\noverload.152\nMobile right-heart thrombi are detected by TTE or transoesopha-\ngeal echocardiography (TOE), or by CT angiography, in <4% of unse-\nlected patients with PE.153\u0002155 Their prevalence may reach 18% among\nPE patients in the intensive care setting.156 Mobile right-heart thrombi\nessentially confirm the diagnosis of PE and are associated with high early\nmortality, especially in patients with RV dysfunction.155,157\u0002159\nIn some patients with suspected acute PE, echocardiography may\ndetect increased RV wall thickness or tricuspid insufficiency jet veloc-\nity beyond values compatible with acute RV pressure overload (>3.8\nm/s or a tricuspid valve peak systolic gradient >60 mmHg).160 In these\ncases, chronic thromboembolic (or other) pulmonary hypertension\n(PH) should be included in the differential diagnosis.\n4.10 Compression ultrasonography\nIn the majority of cases, PE originates from DVT in a lower limb, and only\nrarely from upper-limb DVT (mostly following venous catheterization).\nIn a study using venography, DVT was found in 70% of patients with pro-\nven PE.161 Nowadays, lower-limb CUS has largely replaced venography\nfor diagnosing DVT. CUS has a sensitivity >90% and a specificity of\n\u000395% for proximal symptomatic DVT.162,163 CUS shows a DVT in\n30\u000250% of patients with PE,162\u0002164 and finding a proximal DVT in\npatients suspected of having PE is considered sufficient to warrant antico-\nagulant treatment without further testing.165 However, patients in whom\nPE is indirectly confirmed by the presence of a proximal DVT should\nundergo risk assessment for PE severity and the risk of early death.\nIn the setting of suspected PE, CUS can be limited to a simple four-\npoint examination (bilateral groin and popliteal fossa). The only vali-\ndated diagnostic criterion for DVT is incomplete compressibility of the\nvein, which indicates the presence of a clot, whereas flow measure-\nments are unreliable. A positive proximal CUS result has a high positive\npredictive value for PE. The high diagnostic specificity (96%) along with\na low sensitivity (41%) of CUS in this setting was shown by a recent\nmeta-analysis.165,166 CUS is a useful procedure in the diagnostic strat-\negy of patients with CT contraindications. The probability of a positive\nproximal CUS in suspected PE is higher in patients with signs and symp-\ntoms related to the leg veins than in asymptomatic patients.162,163\n©ESC 2019\nA.

As\ndescribed in section 3.3, initial risk stratification is based on clinical\nsymptoms and signs of haemodynamic instability (Table 4), which indi-\ncate a high risk of early death. In the large remaining group of patients\nwith PE who present without haemodynamic instability, further\n(advanced) risk stratification requires the assessment of two sets of\nprognostic criteria: (i) clinical, imaging, and laboratory indicators of\nPE severity, mostly related to the presence of RV dysfunction; and (ii)\npresence of comorbidity and any other aggravating conditions that\nmay adversely affect early prognosis.\n5.1 Clinical parameters of pulmonary\nembolism severity\nAcute RV failure, defined as a rapidly progressive syndrome with sys-\ntemic congestion resulting from impaired RV filling and/or reduced\nRV flow output,68 is a critical determinant of outcome in acute PE.\nTachycardia, low systolic BP, respiratory insufficiency (tachypnoea\nand/or low SaO2), and syncope, alone or in combination, have been\nassociated with an unfavourable short-term prognosis in acute PE.\n5.2 Imaging of right ventricular size and\nfunction\n5.2.1 Echocardiography\nEchocardiographic parameters used to stratify the early risk of\npatients with PE are graphically presented in Figure 3, and their prog-\nnostic values are summarized in Supplementary Data Table 3.

Four-\nchamber views of the heart by CT angiography can detect RV\nenlargement (RV end-diastolic diameter and RV/LV ratio meas-\nured in the transverse or four-chamber view) as an indicator of\nRV dysfunction. The prognostic value of an enlarged RV is sup-\nported by the results of a prospective multicentre cohort study\nin 457 patients.184 In that study, RV enlargement (defined as an\nRV/LV ratio >_0.9) was an independent predictor of an adverse in-\nhospital outcome, both in the overall population with PE [hazard\nratio (HR) 3.5, 95% CI 1.6\u00027.7] and in haemodynamically stable\npatients (HR 3.8, 95% CI 1.3\u000210.9).184 A meta-analysis of 49\nstudies investigating >13 000 patients with PE confirmed that an\nincreased RV/LV ratio of >_1.0 on CT was associated with a 2.5-\nfold increased risk for all-cause mortality [odds ratio (OR) 2.5,\n95% CI 1.8\u00023.5], and with a five-fold risk for PE-related mortality\n(OR 5.0, 95% CI 2.7\u00029.2).185\nMild RV dilation (RV/LV slightly above 0.9) on CT is a frequent\nfinding (>50% of haemodynamically stable PE patients186), but it\nprobably has minor prognostic significance. However, increasing RV/\nLV diameter ratios are associated with rising prognostic specific-\nity,187,188 even in patients considered to be at ‘low’ risk on the basis\nof clinical criteria.186 Thus, RV/LV ratios >_ 1.0 (instead of 0.9) on CT\nangiography may be more appropriate to indicate poor prognosis.\nApart from RV size and the RV/LV ratio, CT may provide further\nprognostic information based on volumetric analysis of the heart\nchambers189\u0002191 and assessment of contrast reflux to the inferior\nvena cava (IVC).185,192,193\n5.3 Laboratory biomarkers\n5.3.1 Markers of myocardial injury\nElevated plasma troponin concentrations on admission may be associ-\nated with a worse prognosis in the acute phase of PE. Cardiac troponin\nI or T elevation are defined as concentrations above the normal limits,\nand thresholds depend on the assay used; an overview of the cut-off val-\nues has been provided by a meta-analysis.194 Of patients with acute PE,\nbetween 30 (using conventional assays)194,195 and 60% (using high-\nsensitivity assays)196,197 have elevated cardiac troponin I or T concentra-\ntions. A meta-analysis showed that elevated troponin concentrations\nwere associated with an increased risk of mortality, both in unselected\npatients (OR 5.2, 95% CI 3.3\u00028.4) and in those who were haemody-\nnamically stable at presentation (OR 5.9, 95% CI 2.7\u000213.0).195\nOn their own, increased circulating levels of cardiac troponins\nhave relatively low specificity and positive predictive value for\nearly mortality in normotensive patients with acute PE. However,\nwhen interpreted in combination with clinical and imaging findings,\nthey may improve the identification of an elevated PE-related risk\nand\nthe\nfurther\nprognostic\nstratification\nof\nsuch\npatients\n(Supplementary Data Table 4). At the other end of the severity\nspectrum, high-sensitivity troponin assays possess a high negative\npredictive value in the setting of acute PE.197 For example, in a\nprospective multicentre cohort of 526 normotensive patients,\nhigh-sensitivity troponin T concentrations <14 pg/mL had a nega-\ntive predictive value of 98% for excluding an adverse in-hospital\nclinical outcome.63 Age-adjusted high-sensitivity troponin T cut-\noff values (>_14 pg/mL for patients aged <75 years and >_45 pg/mL\nfor those >_75 years) may further improve the negative predictive\nvalue of this biomarker.196\nHeart-type fatty acid-binding protein (H-FABP), an early and sensi-\ntive marker of myocardial injury, provides prognostic information in\nacute PE, both in unselected198,199 and normotensive patients.200,201\nIn a meta-analysis investigating 1680 patients with PE, H-FABP con-\ncentrations >_6 ng/mL were associated with an adverse short-term\noutcome (OR 17.7, 95% CI 6.0\u000251.9) and all-cause mortality (OR\n32.9, 95% CI 8.8\u0002123.2).202\n5.3.2 Markers of right ventricular dysfunction\nRV pressure overload due to acute PE is associated with increased\nmyocardial stretch, which leads to the release of B-type natriuretic\npeptide (BNP) and N-terminal (NT)-proBNP. Thus, the plasma levels\nof natriuretic peptides reflect the severity of RV dysfunction and hae-\nmodynamic compromise in acute PE.203 A meta-analysis found that\n51% of 1132 unselected patients with acute PE had elevated BNP or\nNT-proBNP concentrations on admission; these patients had a 10%\nrisk of early death (95% CI 8.0\u000213%) and a 23% (95% CI 20\u000226%)\nrisk of an adverse clinical outcome.204\nSimilar to cardiac troponins (see above), elevated BNP or NT-\nproBNP concentrations possess low specificity and positive predic-\ntive value (for early mortality) in normotensive patients with PE,205\nbut low levels of BNP or NT-proBNP are capable of excluding an\nunfavourable early clinical outcome, with high sensitivity and a nega-\ntive predictive value.180 In this regard, an NT-proBNP cut-off value\n<500 pg/mL was used to select patients for home treatment in a mul-\nticentre management study.206 If emphasis is placed on increasing the\nprognostic specificity for an adverse early outcome, higher cut-off val-\nues >_600 pg/mL might be more appropriate.207\n5.3.3\nOther laboratory biomarkers\nLactate is a marker of imbalance between tissue oxygen supply and\ndemand, and consequently of severe PE with overt or imminent hae-\nmodynamic compromise. Elevated arterial plasma levels >_2 mmol/L\npredict PE-related complications, both in unselected208 and in initially\nnormotensive209,210 PE patients.\nElevated serum creatinine levels and a decreased (calculated) glo-\nmerular filtration rate are related to 30 day all-cause mortality in acute\nPE.211 Elevated neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and cystatin\nC, both indicating acute kidney injury, are also of prognostic value.212\nA recent meta-analysis investigating 18 616 patients with acute PE\nfound that hyponatraemia predicted in-hospital mortality (OR 5.6,\n95% CI 3.4\u00029.1).213\nVasopressin is released upon endogenous stress, hypotension, and\nlow CO. Its surrogate marker, copeptin, has been reported to be\nuseful for risk stratification of patients with acute PE.214,215 In a single-\ncentre derivation study investigating 268 normotensive PE patients,\ncopeptin levels >_24 pmol/L were associated with a 5.4-fold (95% CI\n1.7\u000217.6) increased risk of an adverse outcome.216 These results\nESC Guidelines\n561\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/41/4/543/5556136 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n..................\nwere confirmed in 843 normotensive PE patients prospectively\nincluded in three European cohorts.217\n5.4 Combined parameters and scores for\nassessment of pulmonary embolism\nseverity\nIn patients who present without haemodynamic instability, individual\nbaseline findings may not suffice to determine and further classify PE\nseverity and PE-related early risk when used as stand-alone parame-\nters. As a result, various combinations of the clinical, imaging, and lab-\noratory parameters described above have been used to build\nprognostic scores, which permit a (semi)quantitative assessment of\nearly PE-related risk of death. Of these, the Bova218\u0002221 and the H-\nFABP (or high-sensitivity troponin T), Syncope, Tachycardia (FAST)\nscores219,222,223\nhave\nbeen\nvalidated\nin\ncohort\nstudies\n(see\nSupplementary Data Table 4). However, their implications for patient\nmanagement remain unclear. To date, only a combination of RV dys-\nfunction on an echocardiogram (or CTPA) with a positive cardiac\ntroponin test has directly been tested as a guide for early therapeutic\ndecisions (anticoagulation plus reperfusion treatment vs. anticoagula-\ntion alone) in a large randomized controlled trial (RCT) of PE patients\npresenting without haemodynamic instability.224\n5.5 Integration of aggravating conditions\nand comorbidity into risk assessment of\nacute pulmonary embolism\nIn addition to the clinical, imaging, and laboratory findings, which are\ndirectly linked to PE severity and PE-related early death, baseline\nparameters related to aggravating conditions and comorbidity are\nnecessary to assess a patient’s overall mortality risk and early out-\ncome.

Testing for laboratory biomarkers such\nas cardiac troponins or natriuretic peptides is not necessary for\nimmediate therapeutic decisions in patients with high-risk PE.\nIn the absence of haemodynamic instability at presentation, further\nrisk stratification of PE is recommended, as it has implications for\nearly discharge vs. hospitalization or monitoring of the patient\n(explained in section 7). Table 8 provides an overview of the clinical,\nimaging, and laboratory parameters used to distinguish intermediate-\nand low-risk PE. The PESI is—in its original or simplified form—the\nmost extensively validated and most broadly used clinical score to\ndate, as it integrates baseline indicators of the severity of the acute PE\nepisode with aggravating conditions and the comorbidity of the\npatient. Overall, a PESI of class I\u0002II or an sPESI of 0 is a reliable pre-\ndictor of low-risk PE.\nIn addition to clinical parameters, patients in the intermediate-risk\ngroup who display evidence of both RV dysfunction (on echocardiog-\nraphy or CTPA) and elevated cardiac biomarker levels in the circula-\ntion (particularly a positive cardiac troponin test) are classified into\nthe intermediate-high-risk category. As will be discussed in more\ndetail in section 7, close monitoring is recommended in these cases to\npermit the early detection of haemodynamic decompensation or col-\nlapse, and consequently the need for rescue reperfusion therapy.179\nPatients in whom the RV appears normal on echocardiography or\nCTPA, and/or who have normal cardiac biomarker levels, belong to\nthe intermediate-low-risk category. As an alternative approach, use\nof further prognostic scores combining clinical, imaging, and labora-\ntory parameters may be considered to semi-quantitatively assess the\nseverity of the PE episode, and distinguish intermediate-high-risk and\nintermediate-low-risk PE. Supplementary Data Table 4 lists the scores\nmost frequently investigated for this purpose in observational\n(cohort) studies; however, none of them has been used in RCTs to\ndate.\nA recent meta-analysis included 21 cohort studies with a total\nof 3295 patients with ‘low-risk’ PE based on a PESI of I\u0002II or an\nsPESI of 0.234 Overall, 34% (95% CI 30\u000239%) of them were\nreported to have signs of RV dysfunction on echocardiography or\nCTPA. Data on early mortality were provided in seven studies\n(1597 patients) and revealed an OR of 4.19 (95% CI 1.39\u000212.58)\nfor death from any cause in the presence of RV dysfunction; ele-\nvated cardiac troponin levels were associated with a comparable\nmagnitude of risk elevation.234 Early all-cause mortality rates\n(1.8% for RV dysfunction and 3.8% for elevated troponin lev-\nels234) were in the lower range of those previously reported for\npatients with intermediate-risk PE.235 Until the clinical implica-\ntions of such discrepancies are clarified, patients with signs of RV\ndysfunction or elevated cardiac biomarkers, despite a low PESI or\nan sPESI of 0, should be classified into the intermediate-low-risk\ncategory.\nTable 8\nClassiﬁcation of pulmonary embolism severity and the risk of early (in-hospital or 30 day) death\nEarly mortality risk\nIndicators of risk\nHaemodynamic \ninstabilitya\nClinical parameters \nof PE severity and/\nor comorbidity:\nPESI class III–V or \nsPESI ≥1\nRV dysfunction on \nTTE or CTPAb\nElevated cardiac \ntroponin levelsc\nHigh\n+\n(+)d\n+\n(+)\nIntermediate\nIntermediate–high\n-\n+e\n+\n+\nIntermediate–low\n-\n+e\nOne (or none) positive\nLow\n-\n-\n-\nAssesment optional; \nif assessed, negative\n©ESC 2019\nBP = blood pressure; CTPA = computed tomography pulmonary angiography; H-FABP = heart-type fatty acid-binding protein; NT-proBNP = N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic\npeptide; PE = pulmonary embolism; PESI = Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index; RV = right ventricular; sPESI = simpliﬁed Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index; TTE = trans-\nthoracic echocardiogram.\naOne of the following clinical presentations (Table 4): cardiac arrest, obstructive shock (systolic BP <90 mmHg or vasopressors required to achieve a BP >_90 mmHg despite an\nadequate ﬁlling status, in combination with end-organ hypoperfusion), or persistent hypotension (systolic BP <90 mmHg or a systolic BP drop >_40 mmHg for >15 min, not\ncaused by new-onset arrhythmia, hypovolaemia, or sepsis).\nbPrognostically relevant imaging (TTE or CTPA) ﬁndings in patients with acute PE, and the corresponding cut-off levels, are graphically presented in Figure 3, and their prognostic\nvalue is summarized in Supplementary Data Table 3.\ncElevation of further laboratory biomarkers, such as NT-proBNP >_600 ng/L, H-FABP >_6 ng/mL, or copeptin >_24 pmol/L, may provide additional prognostic information. These\nmarkers have been validated in cohort studies but they have not yet been used to guide treatment decisions in randomized controlled trials.\ndHaemodynamic instability, combined with PE conﬁrmation on CTPA and/or evidence of RV dysfunction on TTE, is sufﬁcient to classify a patient into the high-risk PE category.\nIn these cases, neither calculation of the PESI nor measurement of troponins or other cardiac biomarkers is necessary.\neSigns of RV dysfunction on TTE (or CTPA) or elevated cardiac biomarker levels may be present, despite a calculated PESI of I\u0002II or an sPESI of 0.234 Until the implications of\nsuch discrepancies for the management of PE are fully understood, these patients should be classiﬁed into the intermediate-risk category.\nESC Guidelines\n563\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/41/4/543/5556136 by guest on 14 January 2026",

Administration of\nsupplemental oxygen is indicated in patients with PE and SaO2 <90%.\nSevere hypoxaemia/respiratory failure that is refractory to conven-\ntional oxygen supplementation could be explained by right-to-left\nshunt through a patent foramen ovale or atrial septal defect.67\nFurther oxygenation techniques should also be considered, including\nhigh-flow oxygen (i.e. a high-flow nasal cannula)236,237 and mechanical\nventilation (non-invasive or invasive) in cases of extreme instability\n(i.e. cardiac arrest), taking into consideration that correction of hypo-\nxaemia will not be possible without simultaneous pulmonary\nreperfusion.\nPatients with RV failure are frequently hypotensive or are highly\nsusceptible to the development of severe hypotension during induc-\ntion of anaesthesia, intubation, and positive-pressure ventilation.\nConsequently, intubation should be performed only if the patient is\nunable to tolerate or cope with non-invasive ventilation. When feasi-\nble, non-invasive ventilation or oxygenation through a high-flow nasal\ncannula should be preferred; if mechanical ventilation is used, care\nshould be taken to limit its adverse haemodynamic effects. In particu-\nlar, positive intrathoracic pressure induced by mechanical ventilation\nmay reduce venous return and worsen low CO due to RV failure in\npatients with high-risk PE; therefore, positive end-expiratory pres-\nsure should be applied with caution. Tidal volumes of approximately\n6 mL/kg lean body weight should be used in an attempt to keep the\nend-inspiratory plateau pressure <30 cm H2O. If intubation is\nneeded, anaesthetic drugs more prone to cause hypotension should\nbe avoided for induction.\n6.1.2 Pharmacological treatment of acute right\nventricular failure\nAcute RV failure with resulting low systemic output is the leading\ncause of death in patients with high-risk PE. The principles of acute\nright heart failure management have been reviewed in a statement\nfrom the Heart Failure Association and the Working Group on\nPulmonary Circulation and Right Ventricular Function of the ESC.68\nAn overview of the current treatment options for acute RV failure is\nprovided in Table 9.\nIf the central venous pressure is low, modest (<_500 mL) fluid chal-\nlenge can be used as it may increase the cardiac index in patients with\nacute PE.238 However, volume loading has the potential to over-\ndistend the RV and ultimately cause a reduction in systemic CO.239\nExperimental studies suggest that aggressive volume expansion is of\nno benefit and may even worsen RV function.240 Cautious volume\nloading may be appropriate if low arterial pressure is combined with\nan absence of elevated filling pressures. Assessment of central venous\npressure by ultrasound imaging of the IVC (a small and/or collapsible\nIVC in the setting of acute high-risk PE indicates low volume status)\nor, alternatively, by central venous pressure monitoring may help\nguide volume loading. If signs of elevated central venous pressure are\nobserved, further volume loading should be withheld.\nUse of vasopressors is often necessary, in parallel with (or while\nwaiting for) pharmacological, surgical, or interventional reperfusion\ntreatment. Norepinephrine can improve systemic haemodynamics\nby bringing about an improvement in ventricular systolic interaction\nand coronary perfusion, without causing a change in PVR.240 Its use\nshould be limited to patients in cardiogenic shock. Based on the\nresults of a small series, the use of dobutamine may be considered\nfor patients with PE, a low cardiac index, and normal BP; however,\nraising the cardiac index may aggravate the ventilation/perfusion mis-\nmatch by further redistributing flow from (partly) obstructed to\nunobstructed vessels.241 Although experimental data suggest that\n5.7 Recommendations for prognostic assessment\nRecommendations\nClassa\nLevelb\nInitial risk stratiﬁcation of suspected or conﬁrmed PE, based on the presence of haemodynamic instability, is recom-\nmended to identify patients at high risk of early mortality.218,219,235\nI\nB\nIn patients without haemodynamic instability, further stratiﬁcation of patients with acute PE into intermediate- and low-\nrisk categories is recommended.179,218,219,235\nI\nB\nIn patients without haemodynamic instability, use of clinical prediction rules integrating PE severity and comorbidity, pref-\nerably the PESI or sPESI, should be considered for risk assessment in the acute phase of PE.178,226,229\nIIa\nB\nAssessment of the RV by imaging methodsc or laboratory biomarkersd should be considered, even in the presence of a\nlow PESI or a negative sPESI.234\nIIa\nB\nIn patients without haemodynamic instability, use of validated scores combining clinical, imaging, and laboratory PE-related\nprognostic factors may be considered to further stratify the severity of the acute PE episode.218\u0002223\nIIb\nC\nPE = pulmonary embolism; PESI = Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index; RV = right ventricle; sPESI = simpliﬁed Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index.\naClass of recommendation.\nbLevel of evidence.\ncTransthoracic echocardiography or computed tomography pulmonary angiography.\ndCardiac troponins or natriuretic peptides.\n564\nESC Guidelines\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/41/4/543/5556136 by guest on 14 January 2026",

The characteristics of NOACs\nused in the treatment of acute PE are summarized in Supplementary\nData Table 6. Owing to their predictable bioavailability and pharma-\ncokinetics, NOACs can be given at fixed doses without routine labo-\nratory monitoring. Compared with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs),\nthere are fewer interactions when NOACs are given concomitantly\nwith other drugs.259 In the phase III VTE trials, the dosages of dabiga-\ntran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban were not reduced in patients with\nmild\u0002moderate renal dysfunction (CrCl between 30\u000260 mL/min),\nwhereas edoxaban was given at a 30 mg dose in these patients.\nPatients with CrCl <25 mL/min were excluded from the trials testing\napixaban, whereas patients with CrCl <30 mL/min were excluded\nfrom those investigating rivaroxaban, edoxaban, and dabigatran\n(Supplementary Data Table 8).\nPhase III trials on the treatment of acute VTE (Supplementary Data\nTable 8), as well as those on extended treatment beyond the first 6\nmonths (see section 8), demonstrated the non-inferiority of NOACs\ncompared with the combination of LMWH with VKA for the preven-\ntion of symptomatic or lethal VTE recurrence, along with significantly\nreduced rates of major bleeding.267 The different drug regimens\ntested in these trials are displayed in Supplementary Data Table 8. In a\nmeta-analysis, the incidence rate of the primary efficacy outcome was\n2.0% for NOAC-treated patients and 2.2% for VKA-treated patients\n[relative risk (RR) 0.88, 95% CI 0.74\u00021.05].268 Major bleeding\noccurred in 1.1% of NOAC-treated patients and 1.7% of VKA-\ntreated patients for an RR of 0.60 (95% CI 0.41\u00020.88). Compared\nwith VKA-treated patients, critical site major bleeding occurred less\nfrequently in NOAC-treated patients (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.23\u0002 0.62);\nin particular, there was a significant reduction in intracranial bleeding\n(RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.21\u00020.68) and in fatal bleeding (RR 0.36, 95% CI\n0.15\u00020.87) with NOACs compared with VKAs.268\nSuggestions for the anticoagulation management of PE in specific\nclinical situations, for which conclusive evidence is lacking, are pre-\nsented in Supplementary Data Table 9.\nPractical guidance for clinicians regarding the handling of NOACs\nand the management of emergency situations related to their use are\nregularly updated by the European Heart Rhythm Association.259\n6.2.3 Vitamin K antagonists\nVKAs have been the gold standard in oral anticoagulation for more\nthan 50 years. When VKAs are used, anticoagulation with UFH,\nLMWH, or fondaparinux should be continued in parallel with the\noral anticoagulant for >_5 days and until the international normalized\nratio (INR) value has been 2.0\u00023.0 for 2 consecutive days. Warfarin\nmay be started at a dose of 10 mg in younger (e.g. aged <60 years)\notherwise healthy patients and at a dose <_5 mg in older patients.269\nThe daily dose is adjusted according to the INR over the next 5\u00027\ndays, aiming for an INR level of 2.0\u00023.0. Pharmacogenetic testing\nmay increase the precision of warfarin dosing.270,271 When used in\naddition to clinical parameters, pharmacogenetic testing improves\nanticoagulation control and may be associated with a reduced risk of\nbleeding, but does not reduce the risk of thromboembolic events or\nmortality.272\nThe implementation of a structured anticoagulant service (most\ncommonly, anticoagulant clinics) appears to be associated with\nincreased time in the therapeutic range and improved clinical out-\ncome, compared with control of anticoagulation by the general prac-\ntitioner.273,274 Finally, in patients who are selected and appropriately\ntrained, self-monitoring of VKA is associated with fewer thrombo-\nembolic events and increased time in the therapeutic range com-\npared with usual care.275\n6.3 Reperfusion treatment\n6.3.1 Systemic thrombolysis\nThrombolytic therapy leads to faster improvements in pulmonary\nobstruction, PAP, and PVR in patients with PE, compared with UFH\nalone; these improvements are accompanied by a reduction in RV\ndilation\non\nechocardiography.276\u0002279\nThe greatest\nbenefit\nis\nobserved when treatment is initiated within 48 h of symptom onset,\nbut thrombolysis can still be useful in patients who have had symp-\ntoms for 6\u000214 days.280 Unsuccessful thrombolysis, as judged by per-\nsistent\nclinical\ninstability\nand\nunchanged\nRV dysfunction\non\nechocardiography after 36 h, has been reported in 8% of high-risk PE\npatients.281\nA meta-analysis of thrombolysis trials that included (but were not\nconfined to) patients with high-risk PE, defined mainly as the presence\nof cardiogenic shock, indicated a significant reduction in the com-\nbined outcome of mortality and recurrent PE (Supplementary Data\nTable 10). This was achieved with a 9.9% rate of severe bleeding and\na 1.7% rate of intracranial haemorrhage.282\nIn normotensive patients with intermediate-risk PE, defined as the\npresence of RV dysfunction and elevated troponin levels, the impact\nof thrombolytic treatment was investigated in the Pulmonary\nEmbolism Thrombolysis (PEITHO) trial.179 Thrombolytic therapy\nwas associated with a significant reduction in the risk of haemody-\nnamic decompensation or collapse, but this was paralleled by an\nincreased risk of severe extracranial and intracranial bleeding.179 In\nthe PEITHO trial, 30 day death rates were low in both treatment\ngroups, although meta-analyses have suggested a reduction in PE-\nrelated and overall mortality of as much as 50\u000260% following throm-\nbolytic treatment in the intermediate-risk category (Supplementary\nData Table 10).282,283\nThe approved regimens and doses of thrombolytic agents for PE,\nas well as the contraindications to this type of treatment, are shown\nin Table 10. Accelerated i.v. administration of recombinant tissue-\ntype plasminogen activator (rtPA; 100 mg over 2 h) is preferable to\nprolonged infusions of first-generation thrombolytic agents (strepto-\nkinase and urokinase). Preliminary reports on the efficacy and safety\nof reduced-dose rtPA284,285 need confirmation by solid evidence\nbefore any recommendations can be made in this regard. UFH may\nbe administered during continuous infusion of alteplase, but should\nbe discontinued during infusion of streptokinase or urokinase.65\nReteplase,286 desmoteplase,287 or tenecteplase179,278,279 have also\nbeen investigated; at present, none of these agents are approved for\nuse in acute PE.\nIt remains unclear whether early thrombolysis for (intermediate-\nor high-risk) acute PE has an impact on clinical symptoms, functional\n566\nESC Guidelines\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/41/4/543/5556136 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n.............................................................................................\nlimitation, or CTEPH at long-term follow-up. A small randomized\ntrial of 83 patients suggested that thrombolysis might improve func-\ntional capacity at 3 months compared with anticoagulation alone.278\nIn the PEITHO trial,179 mild persisting symptoms, mainly dyspnoea,\nwere present in 33% of the patients at long-term (at 41.6 ± 15.7\nmonths) clinical follow-up.288 However, the majority of patients\n(85% in the tenecteplase arm and 96% in the placebo arm) had a low\nor intermediate probability—based on the ESC Guidelines defini-\ntion289—of persisting or new-onset PH at echocardiographic follow-\nup.288 Consequently, the findings of this study do not support a role\nfor thrombolysis with the aim of preventing long-term sequelae (sec-\ntion 10) after intermediate-risk PE, although they are limited by the\nfact that clinical follow-up was available for only 62% of the study\npopulation.\n6.3.2 Percutaneous catheter-directed treatment\nMechanical reperfusion is based on the insertion of a catheter into\nthe pulmonary arteries via the femoral route. Different types of cath-\neters (summarized in Supplementary Data Table 11) are used for\nmechanical fragmentation, thrombus aspiration, or more commonly\na pharmacomechanical approach combining mechanical or ultra-\nsound fragmentation of the thrombus with in situ reduced-dose\nthrombolysis.\nMost knowledge about catheter-based embolectomy is derived\nfrom registries and pooled results from case series.290,291 The\noverall procedural success rates (defined as haemodynamic stabi-\nlization, correction of hypoxia, and survival to hospital discharge)\nof percutaneous catheter-based therapies reported in these stud-\nies have reached 87%;292 however, these results may be subject to\npublication bias. One RCT compared conventional heparin-based\ntreatment and a catheter-based therapy combining ultrasound-\nbased clot fragmentation with low-dose in situ thrombolysis in 59\npatients with intermediate-risk PE. In that study, ultrasound-\nassisted thrombolysis was associated with a larger decrease in the\nRV/LV diameter ratio at 24 h, without an increased risk of bleed-\ning.293 Data from two prospective cohort studies294,295 and a\nregistry,296 with a total of 352 patients, support the improvement\nin RV function, lung perfusion, and PAP in patients with intermedi-\nate- or high-risk PE using this technique. Intracranial haemorrhage\nwas rare, although the rate of Global Utilization of Streptokinase\nand Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Occluded Coronary\nArteries (GUSTO) severe and moderate bleeding complications\nwas 10% in one of these cohorts.294 These results should be inter-\npreted with caution, considering the relatively small numbers of\npatients treated, the lack of studies directly comparing catheter-\ndirected with systemic thrombolytic therapy, and the lack of data\nfrom RCTs on clinical efficacy outcomes.\n6.3.3 Surgical embolectomy\nSurgical embolectomy in acute PE is usually carried out with car-\ndiopulmonary bypass, without aortic cross-clamping and cardio-\nplegic cardiac arrest, followed by incision of the two main\npulmonary arteries with the removal or suction of fresh clots.\nRecent reports have indicated favourable surgical results in high-\nrisk PE, with or without cardiac arrest, and in selected cases of\nintermediate-risk PE.297\u0002300 Among 174 322 patients hospital-\nized between 1999 and 2013 with a diagnosis of PE in New York\nstate, survival and recurrence rates were compared between\npatients who underwent thrombolysis (n = 1854) or surgical\nembolectomy (n = 257) as first-line therapy.297 Overall, there\nTable 10\nThrombolytic regimens, doses, and contraindications\nMolecule\nRegimen\nContraindications to fibrinolysis\nrtPA\n100 mg over 2 h\nAbsolute\nHistory of haemorrhagic stroke or stroke of unknown origin\nIschaemic stroke in previous 6 months\nCentral nervous system neoplasm\nMajor trauma, surgery, or head injury in previous 3 weeks\nBleeding diathesis\nActive bleeding\nRelative\nTransient ischaemic attack in previous 6 months\nOral anticoagulation\nPregnancy or ﬁrst post-partum week\nNon-compressible puncture sites\nTraumatic resuscitation\nRefractory hypertension (systolic BP >180 mmHg)\nAdvanced liver disease\nInfective endocarditis\nActive peptic ulcer\n0.6 mg/kg over 15 min (maximum dose 50 mg)a\nStreptokinase\n250 000 IU as a loading dose over 30 min, followed by\n100 000 IU/h over 12\u000224 h\nAccelerated regimen: 1.5 million IU over 2 h\nUrokinase\n4400 IU/kg as a loading dose over 10 min, followed by\n4400 IU/kg/h over 12\u000224 h\nAccelerated regimen: 3 million IU over 2 h\nBP = blood pressure; IU = international units; rtPA, recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator.\naThis is the accelerated regimen for rtPA in pulmonary embolism; it is not ofﬁcially approved, but it is sometimes used in extreme haemodynamic instability such as cardiac\narrest.\nESC Guidelines\n567\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/41/4/543/5556136 by guest on 14 January 2026",

No difference was found in terms of 5\nyear actuarial survival, but thrombolytic therapy was associated\nwith a higher rate of recurrent PE requiring readmission compared\nwith surgery (7.9 vs. 2.8%). However, the two treatments were not\nrandomly allocated in this observational retrospective study, and the\npatients referred for surgery may have been selected. An analysis of\nthe Society of Thoracic Surgery Database with multicentre data collec-\ntion, including 214 patients submitted for surgical embolectomy for\nhigh- (n = 38) or intermediate-risk (n = 176) PE, revealed an in-hospital\nmortality rate of 12%, with the worst outcome (32%) in the group\nexperiencing pre-operative cardiac arrest.299\nRecent experience appears to support combining ECMO with\nsurgical embolectomy, particularly in patients with high-risk PE\nwith or without the need for cardiopulmonary resuscitation.\nAmong patients who presented with intermediate-risk PE (n =\n28), high-risk PE without cardiac arrest (n = 18), and PE with car-\ndiac arrest (n = 9), the in-hospital and 1 year survival rates were\n93 and 91%, respectively.300\n6.4 Multidisciplinary pulmonary\nembolism teams\nThe concept of multidisciplinary rapid-response teams for the man-\nagement of ‘severe’ (high-risk and selected cases of intermediate-\nrisk) PE emerged in the USA, with increasing acceptance by the medi-\ncal community and implementation in hospitals in Europe and world-\nwide. Set-up of PE response teams (PERTs) is encouraged, as they\naddress the needs of modern systems-based healthcare.301 A PERT\nbrings together a team of specialists from different disciplines includ-\ning, for example, cardiology, pulmonology, haematology, vascular\nmedicine, anaesthesiology/intensive care, cardiothoracic surgery, and\n(interventional) radiology. The team convenes in real time (face-to-\nface or via web conference) to enhance clinical decision-making. This\nallows the formulation of a treatment plan and facilitates its immedi-\nate implementation.301 The exact composition and operating mode\nof a PERT are not fixed, depending on the resources and expertise\navailable in each hospital for the management of acute PE.\n6.5 Vena cava filters\nThe aim of vena cava interruption is to mechanically prevent venous\nclots from reaching the pulmonary circulation.

These strategies have been tested in patients presenting\nwith suspected PE in the emergency department or during their hos-\npital stay,101,164,171,320 and more recently in the primary care set-\nting.111 Withholding of anticoagulation without adherence to\nevidence-based diagnostic strategies was associated with a significant\nincrease in the number of VTE episodes and sudden cardiac death at\n3 month follow-up.12 The most straightforward diagnostic algorithms\nfor suspected PE—with and without haemodynamic instability—are\npresented in Figures 4 and 5, respectively. However, it is recognized\nthat the diagnostic approach for suspected PE may vary, depending\non the availability of, and expertise in, specific tests in various hospi-\ntals and clinical settings.\n©ESC 2019\nBedside TTEb\nCTPA\nRV dysfunction?c\nTreatment of\nhigh-risk PEa\nSearch for other causes of \nshock or instability\nSearch for other causes of\nshock or instability\nSuspected PE in a patient with haemodynamic instabilitya\nYes\nYes\nNegative\nNo\nNod\nPositive\nCTPA immediately available \nand feasible?\nFigure 4 Diagnostic algorithm for patients with suspected high-risk pulmonary embolism presenting with haemodynamic instability.\nCTPA= computed tomography pulmonary angiography; CUS = compression ultrasonography; DVT = deep vein thrombosis; LV = left ventricle;\nPE= pulmonary embolism; RV = right ventricle; TOE= transoesophageal echocardiography; TTE = transthoracic echocardiogram.\naSee Table 4 for definition of haemodynamic instability and high-risk PE.\nbAncillary bedside imaging tests may include TOE, which may detect emboli in the pulmonary artery and its main branches; and bilateral venous CUS,\nwhich may confirm DVT and thus VTE.\ncIn the emergency situation of suspected high-risk PE, this refers mainly to a RV/LV diameter ratio >1.0; the echocardiographic findings of RV dysfunction,\nand the corresponding cut-off levels, are graphically presented in Figure 3, and their prognostic value summarized in Supplementary Data Table 3.\ndIncludes the cases in which the patient’s condition is so critical that it only allows bedside diagnostic tests.

The clinical probability is\nusually high and the differential diagnosis includes cardiac tampo-\nnade, acute coronary syndrome, aortic dissection, acute valvular\ndysfunction, and hypovolaemia. The most useful initial test in this sit-\nuation is bedside TTE, which will yield evidence of acute RV dysfunc-\ntion if acute PE is the cause of the patient’s haemodynamic\ndecompensation. In a highly unstable patient, echocardiographic evi-\ndence of RV dysfunction is sufficient to prompt immediate reperfu-\nsion without further testing. This decision may be strengthened by\nthe (rare) visualization of right heart thrombi.155,157,321,322 Ancillary\nbedside imaging tests include TOE, which may allow direct visualiza-\ntion of thrombi in the pulmonary artery and its main branches, espe-\ncially in patients with RV dysfunction. TOE should be cautiously\nperformed in hypoxaemic patients. Moreover, bedside CUS can\ndetect proximal DVT. As soon as the patient is stabilized using sup-\nportive treatment, final confirmation of the diagnosis by CT angiog-\nraphy should be sought.\nFor unstable patients admitted directly to the catheterization labo-\nratory with suspected acute coronary syndrome, pulmonary angiog-\nraphy may be considered as a diagnostic procedure after the acute\ncoronary syndrome has been excluded, provided that PE is a prob-\nable diagnostic alternative and particularly if percutaneous catheter-\ndirected treatment is a therapeutic option.\n©ESC 2019\nSuspected PE in a patient without haemodynamic instabilitya\nAssess clinical probability of PE\nClinical judgement or prediction ruleb\nLow or intermediate clinical probability,\nor PE unlikely\nPositive\nNegative\nNo PE\nPE confirmedd\nNo PE\nPE confirmedd\nHigh clinical probability\nor PE likely\nD-dimer test\nCTPA\nCTPA\nNo treatmentc\nTreatmentc\nNo treatmentc\nor investigate\nfurthere \nTreatmentc\nFigure 5 Diagnostic algorithm for patients with suspected pulmonary embolism without haemodynamic instability.\nCTPA= computed tomography pulmonary angiography/angiogram; PE = pulmonary embolism.\naThe proposed diagnostic strategy for pregnant women with suspected acute PE is discussed in section 9.\nbTwo alternative classification schemes may be used for clinical probability assessment, i.e. a three-level scheme (clinical probability defined as low, inter-\nmediate, or high) or a two-level scheme (PE unlikely or PE likely). When using a moderately sensitive assay, D-dimer measurement should be restricted to\npatients with low clinical probability or a PE-unlikely classification, while highly sensitive assays may also be used in patients with intermediate clinical proba-\nbility of PE due to a higher sensitivity and negative predictive value. Note that plasma D-dimer measurement is of limited use in suspected PE occurring in\nhospitalized patients.\ncTreatment refers to anticoagulation treatment for PE.\ndCTPA is considered diagnostic of PE if it shows PE at the segmental or more proximal level.\neIn case of a negative CTPA in patients with high clinical probability, investigation by further imaging tests may be considered before withholding PE-specific\ntreatment.\nESC Guidelines\n571\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/41/4/543/5556136 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n.............................................................................................................................................................................\n7.1.2 Suspected pulmonary embolism without\nhaemodynamic instability\n7.1.2.1 Strategy based on computed tomographic pulmonary\nangiography\nThe proposed strategy based on CTPA is shown in Figure 5. In patients\nadmitted to the emergency department, measurement of plasma D-\ndimer is the logical first step following the assessment of clinical proba-\nbility and allows PE to be ruled out in \u000330% of outpatients. D-dimer\nshould not be measured in patients with a high clinical probability of\nPE, owing to a low negative predictive value in this population.323 It is\nalso less useful in hospitalized patients because the number that needs\nto be tested to obtain a clinically relevant negative result is high.\nIn most centres, multidetector CTPA is the second-line test in\npatients with an elevated D-dimer level and the first-line test in\npatients with a high clinical probability of PE. CTPA is considered to\nbe diagnostic of PE when it shows a clot at least at the segmental level\nof the pulmonary arterial tree. False-negative results of CTPA have\nbeen reported in patients with a high clinical probability of PE;115\nhowever, such discrepancies are infrequent and the 3 month throm-\nboembolic risk was low in these patients.171 Accordingly, both the\nnecessity of performing further tests and the nature of these tests\nremain controversial in these clinical situations.\n7.1.2.2 Strategy based on ventilation/perfusion scintigraphy\nIn hospitals in which V/Q scintigraphy is readily available, it is a valid\noption for patients with an elevated D-dimer and a contraindication to\nCTPA. Also, V/Q scintigraphy may be preferred over CTPA to avoid\nunnecessary radiation, particularly in younger patients and in female\npatients in whom thoracic CT might raise the lifetime risk of breast\ncancer.324 V/Q lung scintigraphy is diagnostic (with either normal- or\nhigh-probability findings) in \u000330\u000250% of emergency ward patients\nwith suspected PE.75,122,134,325 The proportion of diagnostic V/Q scans\nis higher in patients with a normal chest X-ray, and this might support\nthe use of a V/Q scan as a first-line imaging test for PE in younger\npatients, depending on local availability.326 The number of patients with\ninconclusive findings may further be reduced by taking into account\nclinical probability. Thus, patients with a non-diagnostic lung scan and\nlow clinical probability of PE have a low prevalence of confirmed\nPE,124,325 and the negative predictive value of this combination is fur-\nther increased by the absence of a DVT on lower-limb CUS. If a high-\nprobability lung scan is obtained from a patient with low clinical proba-\nbility of PE, confirmation by other tests should be considered.\n7.2 Treatment strategies\n7.2.1 Emergency treatment of high-risk pulmonary\nembolism\nThe algorithm for a risk-adjusted therapeutic approach to acute PE is\nshown in Figure 6; an emergency management algorithm specifically for\npatients with suspected acute high-risk PE is proposed in Supplementary\nData Figure 1. Primary reperfusion treatment, in most cases systemic\nthrombolysis, is the treatment of choice for patients with high-risk PE.\nSurgical pulmonary embolectomy or percutaneous catheter-directed\ntreatment are alternative reperfusion options in patients with contraindi-\ncations to thrombolysis, if expertise with either of these methods and\nthe appropriate resources are available on-site.\nFollowing reperfusion treatment and haemodynamic stabilization,\npatients recovering from high-risk PE can be switched from\nparenteral to oral anticoagulation. As patients belonging to this risk\ncategory were excluded from the phase III NOAC trials, the optimal\ntime point for this transition has not been determined by existing evi-\ndence but should instead be based on clinical judgement. The specifi-\ncations concerning the higher initial dose of apixaban or rivaroxaban\n(for 1 and 3 weeks after PE diagnosis, respectively), or the minimum\noverall period (5 days) of heparin anticoagulation before switching to\ndabigatran or edoxaban, must be followed (see Supplementary Data\nTable 8 for tested and approved regimens).\n7.2.2 Treatment of intermediate-risk pulmonary\nembolism\nFor most cases of acute PE without haemodynamic compromise,\nparenteral or oral anticoagulation (without reperfusion techniques)\nis adequate treatment. As shown in Figure 6, normotensive patients\nwith at least one indicator of elevated PE-related risk, or with aggra-\nvating conditions or comorbidity, should be hospitalized. In this\ngroup, patients with signs of RV dysfunction on echocardiography or\nCTPA (graphically presented in Figure 3), accompanied by a positive\ntroponin test, should be monitored over the first hours or days due\nto the risk of early haemodynamic decompensation and circulatory\ncollapse.179 Routine primary reperfusion treatment, notably full-dose\nsystemic thrombolysis, is not recommended, as the risk of potentially\nlife-threatening bleeding complications appears too high for the\nexpected benefits from this treatment.179 Rescue thrombolytic ther-\napy or, alternatively, surgical embolectomy or\npercutaneous\ncatheter-directed treatment should be reserved for patients who\ndevelop signs of haemodynamic instability. In the PEITHO trial, the\nmean time between randomization and death or haemodynamic\ndecompensation was 1.79 ± 1.60 days in the placebo (heparin-only)\narm.179 Therefore, it appears reasonable to leave patients with inter-\nmediate-high-risk PE on LMWH anticoagulation over the first 2 - 3\ndays and ensure that they remain stable before switching to oral anti-\ncoagulation. As mentioned in the previous section, the specifications\nconcerning the increased initial dose of apixaban or rivaroxaban, or\nthe minimum overall period of heparin anticoagulation before switch-\ning to dabigatran or edoxaban, must be followed.\nSuggestions for the anticoagulation and overall management of\nacute PE in specific clinical situations, for which conclusive evidence is\nlacking, are presented in Supplementary Data Table 9.\n7.2.3 Management of low-risk pulmonary embolism: tri-\nage for early discharge and home treatment\nAs a general rule, early discharge of a patient with acute PE and con-\ntinuation of anticoagulant treatment at home should be considered if\nthree sets of criteria are fulfilled: (i) the risk of early PE-related death\nor serious complications is low (section 5); (ii) there is no serious\ncomorbidity or aggravating condition(s) (see section 5) that would\nmandate hospitalization; and (iii) proper outpatient care and anticoa-\ngulant treatment can be provided, considering the patient’s (antici-\npated) compliance, and the possibilities offered by the healthcare\nsystem and social infrastructure.\nRandomized trials and prospective management cohort studies\nthat investigated the feasibility and safety of early discharge, and\nhome treatment, of PE adhered to these principles, even though\n572\nESC Guidelines\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/41/4/543/5556136 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n©ESC 2019\nFigure 6 Central Illustration.

They integrate aspects of\nPE severity, comorbidity, and the feasibility of home treatment. If\nthe answer to one or more of the questions is ‘yes’, then the\npatient cannot be discharged early. In a single-arm management\ntrial that used these criteria to select candidates for home treat-\nment, the 3 month rate of recurrent VTE was 2.0% (0.8\u00024.3%) in\npatients with acute PE who were discharged within 24 h.317 In a\nsubsequent non-inferiority trial that randomized 550 patients to\ndirect discharge based on the Hestia criteria alone vs. additional\nNT-proBNP testing and discharge if levels were <_500 pg/mL, the\nprimary outcome (30 day PE- or bleeding-related mortality, cardi-\nopulmonary resuscitation, or admission to an intensive care unit)\nwas very low in both arms. The results suggest no incremental\nvalue of natriuretic-peptide testing in patients who are eligible for\nhome treatment based on the Hestia criteria, although the study\nwas not powered to exclude this possibility.318\nThe PESI and its simplified form, the sPESI (Table 7), also integrate\nclinical parameters of PE severity and comorbidity to permit assess-\nment of overall 30 day mortality. Compared with the Hestia criteria,\nthe PESI is more standardized, but it contains a less-comprehensive\nlist of aggravating conditions; moreover, the sPESI excludes all\npatients with cancer from the low-risk category (compare Table 7\nwith Supplementary Data Table 12). The PESI was not primarily\ndeveloped as a tool to select candidates for home treatment, but it\nhas been used—in combination with additional feasibility criteria—in\na trial of 344 patients randomized to inpatient vs. outpatient treat-\nment of PE.178 One (0.6%) patient in each treatment group died\nwithin 90 days.178\nIn patients who were included in prospective cohort studies and\ntreated at home, with or without a short hospitalization period, the 3\nmonth rates of thromboembolic recurrence, major bleeding, and\ndeath were 1.75, 1.43, and 2.83%, respectively.327\nIn summary, the currently available evidence indicates that both\nthe Hestia rule and the PESI or sPESI appear capable of reliably identi-\nfying patients who are (i) at low PE-related risk, and (ii) free of serious\ncomorbidity. Consequently, either may be used for clinical triage\naccording to local experience and preference. If a PESI- or sPESI-\nbased approach is chosen, it must be combined with assessment of\nthe feasibility of early discharge and home treatment; this assessment\nis already integrated into the Hestia criteria.\nA more difficult decision related to immediate or early dis-\ncharge is whether the exclusion of intermediate-risk PE on clinical\ngrounds alone is adequate, or whether the assessment of RV dys-\nfunction or myocardial injury (see section 5) by an imaging test or a\nlaboratory biomarker is necessary to provide maximal safety for\nthe patient in this ‘vulnerable’ early period. A systematic review\nand meta-analysis of cohort studies suggested that the prognostic\nsensitivity is increased further when clinical criteria (e.g. PESI or\nsPESI) are combined with imaging findings, or laboratory bio-\nmarker levels.234 A multicentre prospective management trial\ntested this hypothesis, investigating the efficacy and safety of early\ndischarge, and ambulatory rivaroxaban treatment, in patients\nselected by clinical criteria and an absence of RV dysfunction.\nOverall, \u000320% of the screened unselected patients with PE were\nincluded. At the predefined interim analysis of 525 patients (50%\nof the planned population), the 3 month rate of symptomatic or\nfatal recurrent VTE was 0.6% (one-sided upper 99.6% CI 2.1%),\npermitting the early rejection of the null hypothesis and termina-\ntion of the trial. Major bleeding occurred in six (1.2%) of the\npatients in the safety population. There were no PE-related\ndeaths.319 In view of the existing evidence—and taking into con-\nsideration (i) the catastrophic scenario of early death if a patient\nwith acute PE is falsely judged to be at low risk on clinical grounds\nalone and discharged ‘too early’ (as described in a prematurely\nterminated trial328), and (ii) the ease and minimal additional effort\nof assessing RV size and function at presentation by echocardiog-\nraphy, or on the CTPA performed to diagnose the PE event\nitself329 (section 5)—it is wise to exclude RV dysfunction and right\nheart thrombi if immediate or early (within the first 24\u000248 h) dis-\ncharge of the patient is planned.\n8 Chronic treatment and\nprevention of recurrence\nThe aim of anticoagulation after acute PE is to complete the treat-\nment of the acute episode and prevent recurrence of VTE over\nthe long-term. Current drugs and regimens for the initial phase,\nand the first months of anticoagulant treatment, are described\ninsection 6.\nMost of the randomized studies focusing on long-term anticoagula-\ntion for VTE have included patients with DVT, with or without PE;\nonly two randomized studies have specifically focused on patients\nwith PE.330,331 The incidence of recurrent VTE does not appear to\ndepend on the clinical manifestation of the first event (i.e. it is similar\nafter PE and after proximal DVT). However, in patients who have\nhad a PE, VTE more frequently recurs as PE, while in patients who\nhave had a DVT, it tends to recur more frequently as DVT.332 As a\nconsequence, the case fatality rate of recurrent VTE in patients who\nhave previously had a PE is twice as high as that of VTE recurrence\nafter DVT.333,334\nLandmark clinical trials have evaluated various durations of antico-\nagulant treatment with VKAs for VTE.330,331,335\u0002337 The findings of\nthese studies permit the following conclusions. First, all patients with\nPE should receive >_3 months of anticoagulant treatment. Second,\nafter withdrawal of anticoagulant treatment, the risk of recurrence is\nexpected to be similar if anticoagulants are stopped after 3\u00026\nmonths compared with longer treatment periods (e.g. 12\u000224\nmonths). Third, extended oral anticoagulant treatment reduces the\nrisk for recurrent VTE by <_90%, but this benefit is partially offset by\nthe risk of bleeding.\nOral anticoagulants are highly effective in preventing recurrent\nVTE during treatment, but they do not eliminate the risk of subse-\nquent recurrence after the discontinuation of treatment.330,331\nBased on this fact on the one hand, and considering the bleeding\nrisk of anticoagulation treatment on the other, the clinically\nimportant question is how to best select candidates for extended\nor indefinite anticoagulation. Involvement of the patient in the\ndecision-making process is crucial to optimize and maintain treat-\nment adherence.\n574\nESC Guidelines\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/41/4/543/5556136 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n.................................................................\n8.1 Assessment of venous\nthromboembolism recurrence risk\nThe risk for recurrent VTE after discontinuation of treatment is\nrelated to the features of the index PE (or, in the broader sense,\nVTE) event. A study, which followed patients after a first episode of\nacute PE, found that the recurrence rate after discontinuation of\ntreatment was \u00032.5% per year after PE associated with transient risk\nfactors, compared with 4.5% per year after PE occurring in the\nabsence of known cancer, known thrombophilia, or any transient risk\nfactor.331 Similar observations were made in other prospective stud-\nies in patients with DVT.337 Advancing the concept further, random-\nized anticoagulation trials over the past 15 years, which have focused\non secondary VTE prevention, have classified patients into distinct\ngroups based on their risk of VTE recurrence after discontinuation of\nanticoagulant treatment. In general, these groups are: (i) patients in\nwhom a strong (major) transient or reversible risk factor, most com-\nmonly major surgery or trauma, can be identified as being responsible\nfor the acute (index) episode; (ii) patients in whom the index episode\nmight be partly explained by the presence of a weak (minor) transient\nor reversible risk factor, or if a non-malignant risk factor for thrombo-\nsis persists; (iii) patients in whom the index episode occurred in the\nabsence of any identifiable risk factor (the present Guidelines avoid\nterms such as ‘unprovoked’ or ‘idiopathic’ VTE); (iv) patients with one\nor more previous episodes of VTE, and those with a major persistent\npro-thrombotic condition such as antiphospholipid antibody syn-\ndrome; and (v) patients with active cancer.338\nTable 11 shows examples of transient/reversible and persistent\nrisk factors for VTE, classified by the risk of long-term recurrence.\nAs active cancer is a major risk factor for recurrence of VTE, but\nalso for bleeding while on anticoagulant treatment,339 section 8.4 is\nspecifically dedicated to the management of PE in patients with\ncancer.\nOverall, assessment of the VTE recurrence risk after acute PE, in\nthe absence of a major transient or reversible risk factor, is a complex\nissue. Beyond the examples listed in Table 11, patients who are car-\nriers of some forms of hereditary thrombophilia, notably those with\nconfirmed deficiency of antithrombin, protein C, or protein S, and\npatients with homozygous factor V Leiden or homozygous pro-\nthrombin G20210A mutation, are often candidates for indefinite anti-\ncoagulant treatment after a first episode of PE occurring in the\nabsence of a major reversible risk factor.

In general, these groups are: (i) patients in\nwhom a strong (major) transient or reversible risk factor, most com-\nmonly major surgery or trauma, can be identified as being responsible\nfor the acute (index) episode; (ii) patients in whom the index episode\nmight be partly explained by the presence of a weak (minor) transient\nor reversible risk factor, or if a non-malignant risk factor for thrombo-\nsis persists; (iii) patients in whom the index episode occurred in the\nabsence of any identifiable risk factor (the present Guidelines avoid\nterms such as ‘unprovoked’ or ‘idiopathic’ VTE); (iv) patients with one\nor more previous episodes of VTE, and those with a major persistent\npro-thrombotic condition such as antiphospholipid antibody syn-\ndrome; and (v) patients with active cancer.338\nTable 11 shows examples of transient/reversible and persistent\nrisk factors for VTE, classified by the risk of long-term recurrence.\nAs active cancer is a major risk factor for recurrence of VTE, but\nalso for bleeding while on anticoagulant treatment,339 section 8.4 is\nspecifically dedicated to the management of PE in patients with\ncancer.\nOverall, assessment of the VTE recurrence risk after acute PE, in\nthe absence of a major transient or reversible risk factor, is a complex\nissue. Beyond the examples listed in Table 11, patients who are car-\nriers of some forms of hereditary thrombophilia, notably those with\nconfirmed deficiency of antithrombin, protein C, or protein S, and\npatients with homozygous factor V Leiden or homozygous pro-\nthrombin G20210A mutation, are often candidates for indefinite anti-\ncoagulant treatment after a first episode of PE occurring in the\nabsence of a major reversible risk factor. In view of these possible\nimplications, testing for thrombophilia (including antiphospholipid\nTable 11\nCategorization of risk factors for venous thromboembolism based on the risk of recurrence over the long-\nterm\nEstimated risk for long-term \nrecurrencea\nRisk factor category\nfor index PEb\nExamplesb\nLow (<3% per year)\nMajor transient or reversible factors \nassociated with >10-fold increased risk \nfor the index VTE event (compared to \npatients without the risk factor)\n• Surgery with general anaesthesia for >30 min\n to bed in hospital (only “bathroom  \n privileges”) for ≥3 days due to an acute illness, or acute \n exacerbation of a chronic illness\n• Trauma with fractures\nIntermediate (3–8% per year)\nTransient or reversible factors \nassociated with ≤10-fold increased risk \nfor \n (index) VTE\n• Minor surgery (general anaesthesia for <30 min)\n• Admission to hospital for <3 days with an acute illness\n• Oestrogen therapy/contraception\n• Pregnancy or puerperium\n to bed out of hospital for ≥3 days with  \n an acute illness\n• Leg injury (without fracture) associated with reduced  \n mobility for ≥3 days\n• Long-haul \nNon-malignant persistent risk factors\n bowel disease\n• Active autoimmune disease\nNo \n risk factor\nHigh (>8% per year)\n• Active cancer\n• One or more previous episodes of VTE in the absence  \n of a major transient or reversible factor\n• Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome\n©ESC 2019\nPE = pulmonary embolism; VTE = venous thromboembolism.\naIf anticoagulation is discontinued after the ﬁrst 3 months (based on data from Baglin et al.340 and Iorio et al.341).\nbThe categorization of risk factors for the index VTE event is in line with that proposed by the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis.338 The present\nGuidelines avoid terms such as ‘provoked’, ‘unprovoked’, or ‘idiopathic’ VTE.\nESC Guidelines\n575\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/41/4/543/5556136 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n.......................................................................................................................................................................\nantibodies and lupus anticoagulant)342 may be considered in patients\nin whom VTE occurs at a young age (e.g. aged <50 years) and in the\nabsence of an otherwise identifiable risk factor, especially when this\noccurs against the background of a strong family history of VTE. In\nsuch cases, testing may help to tailor the regimen and dose of the\nanticoagulant agent over the long-term. On the other hand, no evi-\ndence of a clinical benefit of extended anticoagulant treatment is cur-\nrently available for carriers of heterozygous factor V Leiden or\nprothrombin 20210A mutation.\nA number of risk prediction models have been developed for the\nassessment of the risk of recurrence in an individual patient\n(Supplementary Data Table 13).343,344 The clinical value and, in partic-\nular, the possible therapeutic implications of these models in the\nNOAC era are unclear.\n8.2 Anticoagulant-related bleeding risk\nIncidence estimates from cohort studies conducted more than 15\nyears ago reported an \u00033% annual incidence of major bleeding in\npatients treated with VKAs.345 Meta-analyses of phase III studies\nfocusing on the first 3 - 12 months of anticoagulant treatment showed\nan \u000340% reduction in the risk for major bleeding with NOACs com-\npared with VKAs.346 The risk of major bleeding is higher in the first\nmonth of anticoagulant treatment, and then declines and remains sta-\nble over time. Based on currently available evidence, risk factors\ninclude: (i) advanced age (particularly >75 years); (ii) previous bleed-\ning (if not associated with a reversible or treatable cause) or anaemia;\n(iii) active cancer; (iv) previous stroke, either haemorrhagic or ischae-\nmic; (v) chronic renal or hepatic disease; (vi) concomitant antiplatelet\ntherapy or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (to be avoided, if\npossible); (vii) other serious acute or chronic illness; and (viii) poor\nanticoagulation control.\nExisting bleeding risk scores and their current validation status\nare reviewed in Supplementary DataTable 14. The patient’s bleed-\ning risk should be assessed, either by implicit judgement after eval-\nuating individual risk factors or by the use of a bleeding risk score,\nat the time of initiation of anticoagulant treatment. It should be\nreassessed periodically (e.g. once a year in patients at low risk, and\nevery 3 or 6 months in patients at high risk for bleeding). Bleeding\nrisk assessment should be used to identify and treat modifiable\nbleeding risk factors, and it may influence decision-making on the\nduration and regimen/dose of anticoagulant treatment after acute\nPE.\n8.3 Regimens and treatment durations\nwith non-vitamin K antagonist oral anti-\ncoagulants, and with other non-vitamin K\nantagonist antithrombotic drugs\nAll patients with PE should be treated with anticoagulants for >_3\nmonths.347 Beyond this period, the balance between the risk of\nVTE recurrence and that of bleeding, which has been used to\nselect candidates for extended anticoagulation after a first VTE\nevent in the VKA era, is currently being revisited based on the\nlower bleeding rates with NOACs. However, despite the\nimproved safety of these drugs compared with VKAs, treatment\nwith NOACs is not without risk. Phase III clinical trials on the\nextended treatment of VTE have shown that the rate of major\nbleeding may be \u00031%, and that of clinically relevant non-major\n(CRNM) bleeding as high as 6%. Bleeding rates may be higher in\neveryday clinical practice.348,349\nThe NOAC trials that focused on extended VTE treatment are\nsummarized in Supplementary Data Table 15. In all studies, patients\nwith PE made up approximately one-third of the entire study popula-\ntion, while the remaining two-thirds were patients with proximal\nDVT but no clinically overt PE. Patients needed to have completed\nthe initial and long-term anticoagulation phase to be included in the\nextended studies.\nDabigatran was compared with warfarin or placebo in two differ-\nent studies (Supplementary Data Table 15).350 In these studies, dabi-\ngatran was non-inferior to warfarin for the prevention of confirmed\nrecurrent symptomatic VTE or VTE-related death, and more effec-\ntive than placebo for the prevention of symptomatic recurrent VTE\nor unexplained death.350 The rate of major bleeding was 0.9% with\ndabigatran compared to 1.8% with warfarin (HR 0.52, 95% CI\n0.27\u00021.02).350\nRivaroxaban was compared with placebo or aspirin in two differ-\nent studies in patients who had completed 6\u000212 months of anticoa-\ngulation treatment for a first VTE event (Supplementary Data\nTable 15). Treatment with rivaroxaban [20 mg once a day (o.d.)]\nreduced recurrent VTE by \u000380%, with a 6.0% incidence of major or\nCRNM bleeding as compared to 1.2% with placebo.351 Rivaroxaban\ngiven at a dose of 20 or 10 mg o.d. was compared with aspirin (100\nmg o.d.) in 3365 patients.352 Both doses of rivaroxaban reduced\nsymptomatic recurrent fatal or non-fatal VTE by \u000370% in compari-\nson with aspirin. No significant differences in the rates of major or\nCRNM bleeding were shown between either dose of rivaroxaban\nand aspirin.352\nPatients with VTE were randomized to receive two different doses\nof apixaban [2.5 or 5 mg twice a day (bis in die: b.i.d.)] or placebo after\n6\u000212 months of initial anticoagulation (Supplementary Data\nTable 15).353 Both doses of apixaban reduced the incidence of symp-\ntomatic recurrent VTE or death from any cause compared with pla-\ncebo, with no safety concerns.353\nPatients at high bleeding risk—based on the investigator’s judge-\nment, the patient’s medical history, and the results of laboratory\nexaminations—were excluded from the extension studies men-\ntioned above; this was also the case for studies on extended anticoa-\ngulation with VKAs.330,331 This fact should be taken into account\nduring triage of a patient for extended anticoagulation with one of\nthe above regimens.\nIn a randomized, open-label study in high-risk patients with\nantiphospholipid syndrome (testing triple positive for lupus anticoa-\ngulant, anticardiolipin, and anti-b2-glycoprotein I), rivaroxaban\nwas associated with an increased rate of thromboembolic and\nmajor bleeding events compared with warfarin (HR for the compo-\nsite primary outcome 6.7; 95% CI 1.5\u000230.5).354 At present, NOACs\nare not an alternative to VKAs for patients with antiphospholipid\nsyndrome.\nIn two trials with a total of 1224 patients, extended therapy with\naspirin (after termination of standard oral anticoagulation) was\n576\nESC Guidelines\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/41/4/543/5556136 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n......................\nassociated with a 30\u000235% reduction in the risk of recurrence com-\npared with placebo (Supplementary Data Table 15).355,356 However,\nmore recently, another trial demonstrated the superiority of anticoa-\ngulation with rivaroxaban, either 20 or 10 mg o.d., over aspirin for\nsecondary prophylaxis of VTE recurrence.352\nA randomized, placebo controlled study evaluated sulodexide (2\n\u0004 250 lipasemic unit capsules b.i.d.) for the prevention of recurrence\nin 615 patients with a first VTE event without an identifiable risk fac-\ntor, who had completed 3\u000212 months of oral anticoagulant treat-\nment (Supplementary Data Table 15).357 Sulodexide reduced the risk\nof recurrence by \u000350% with no apparent increase in bleeding events.\nHowever, only 8% of patients in this study had PE as the index VTE\nevent.357\n8.4 Recommendations for the regimen and duration of anticoagulation after pulmonary embolism in patients without\ncancer\nRecommendations\nClassa\nLevelb\nTherapeutic anticoagulation for >_ 3 months is recommended for all patients with PE.347\nI\nA\nPatients in whom discontinuation of anticoagulation after 3 months is recommended\nFor patients with ﬁrst PE/VTE secondary to a major transient/reversible risk factor, discontinuation of therapeutic oral\nanticoagulation is recommended after 3 months.331,340,341\nI\nB\nPatients in whom extension of anticoagulation beyond 3 months is recommended\nOral anticoagulant treatment of indeﬁnite duration is recommended for patients presenting with recurrent VTE (that is,\nwith at least one previous episode of PE or DVT) not related to a major transient or reversible risk factor.358\nI\nB\nOral anticoagulant treatment with a VKA for an indeﬁnite period is recommended for patients with antiphospholipid anti-\nbody syndrome.359\nI\nB\nPatients in whom extension of anticoagulation beyond 3 months should be consideredc,d\nExtended oral anticoagulation of indeﬁnite duration should be considered for patients with a ﬁrst episode of PE and no\nidentiﬁable risk factor.330,331,347,351\u0002353\nIIa\nA\nExtended oral anticoagulation of indeﬁnite duration should be considered for patients with a ﬁrst episode of PE associated\nwith a persistent risk factor other than antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.330,352,353\nIIa\nC\nExtended oral anticoagulation of indeﬁnite duration should be considered for patients with a ﬁrst episode of PE associated\nwith a minor transient or reversible risk factor.330,331,352\nIIa\nC\nNOAC dose in extended anticoagulatione\nIf extended oral anticoagulation is decided after PE in a patient without cancer, a reduced dose of the NOACs apixaban\n(2.5 mg b.i.d.) or rivaroxaban (10 mg o.d.) should be considered after 6 months of therapeutic anticoagulation.352,353\nIIa\nA\nExtended treatment with alternative antithrombotic agents\nIn patients who refuse to take or are unable to tolerate any form of oral anticoagulants, aspirin or sulodexide may be con-\nsidered for extended VTE prophylaxis.355\u0002357\nIIb\nB\nFollow-up of the patient under anticoagulation\nIn patients who receive extended anticoagulation, it is recommended that their drug tolerance and adherence, hepatic and\nrenalf function, and bleeding risk be reassessed at regular intervals.259\nI\nC\nb.i.d. = bis in die (twice a day);

however, the\noverall rate of recurrent VTE in the control arm was lower than that\npreviously observed, probably as a result of the recruitment of\npatients with a lower cancer-specific thrombotic risk.360 Overall,\nLMWHs were found to decrease the risk of recurrent VTE by 40%\nwith a risk of major bleeding complications similar to that of VKAs.365\nAccordingly, LMWHs have become the standard of care. However,\nthese agents are associated with a relevant cost and burden for\npatients. In addition, the absolute rate of recurrent VTE while on\nLMWH remains high (7\u00029%) compared with that observed in non-\ncancer patients with VTE on conventional treatment (1.5\u00023%).365\nNOACs could make the treatment of VTE easier and more con-\nvenient in patients with cancer, due to their oral administration in\nfixed-dose regimens and their lower cost compared with LMWH.\nHowever, only 3\u00029% of patients included in phase III studies with\nNOACs\nfor\nthe\ntreatment\nof\nVTE\nhad\nconcomitant\ncan-\ncer.260,261,312,314,351 A randomized, open-label trial compared edoxa-\nban with LMWH in the secondary prevention of VTE in 1050\npatients with cancer-associated thrombosis (mostly symptomatic or\nasymptomatic PE).366 Edoxaban (60 mg o.d., reduced to 30 mg in sub-\njects with moderate renal impairment, low body weight, or concomi-\ntant need for strong inhibitors of glycoprotein-P) was started after 5\ndays of LMWH and treatment was given for >_6 months. Edoxaban\nwas non-inferior to dalteparin in the prevention of VTE recurrence\nor major bleeding over 12 months after randomization (HR 0.97,\n95% CI 0.70\u00021.36). Major bleeding occurred in 6.9% of the patients\nin the edoxaban arm and 4.0% in the dalteparin arm (difference in risk\n2.9 percentage points, 95% CI 0.1\u00025.6). This difference appears to\nhave been mainly accounted for by the high rate of bleeding in\npatients with gastrointestinal cancer allocated to the edoxaban\ngroup.366 Similar results were reported by a randomized, open-label\npilot trial comparing rivaroxaban with dalteparin in 406 patients with\nVTE and cancer, 58% of whom had metastases.367 A significant\ndecrease in the risk of recurrent VTE was observed with rivaroxaban\n(HR 0.43, 95% CI 0.19\u00020.99). The 6 month cumulative rate of major\nbleeding, which was mostly gastrointestinal, was 6% (95% CI 3\u000211%)\nfor rivaroxaban and 4% (95% CI 2\u00028%) for dalteparin (HR 1.83, 95%\nCI 0.68\u00024.96). Corresponding rates of CRNM bleeds were 13%\n(95% CI 9\u000219%) and 4% (95% CI 2\u00029%), respectively (HR 3.76,\n95% CI 1.63\u00028.69).367\nBased on the currently available evidence, as described above,\npatients with acute PE and cancer, particularly those with gastrointes-\ntinal cancer, should be encouraged to continue LMWH for >_ 3\u00026\nmonths. This also applies to patients in whom oral treatment is unfea-\nsible due to problems of intake or absorption, and to those with\nsevere renal impairment. In all other cases, especially in patients with\nan anticipated low risk of bleeding and without gastrointestinal\ntumours, the choice between LMWH and edoxaban or rivaroxaban\nis left to the discretion of the physician, and the patient’s preference.\nOwing to the high risk for recurrence, patients with cancer should\nreceive indefinite anticoagulation after a first episode of VTE.\nAlthough existing evidence is limited, it is conceivable that once can-\ncer is cured the risk for recurrence decreases and anticoagulation\ncan be stopped. However, the definition of cured cancer is not always\nclear. The risk of recurrence of PE in cancer was assessed in a cohort\nstudy of 543 patients and was validated in an independent set of 819\npatients.368 The proposed score to predict the risk of recurrence\nincluded breast cancer (minus 1 point), Tumour Node Metastasis\nstage I or II (minus 1 point), and female sex, lung cancer, and previous\nVTE (plus 1 point each). Patients with a score <_0 were at low risk\n(<_4.5%) and those with a score >_1 were at high (>_19%) risk of VTE\nrecurrence over the first 6 months.368\nAfter the first 3\u00026 months, extended anticoagulation may consist\nof continuation of LMWH or transition to an oral anticoagulant. Two\ncohort studies have assessed the safety of extended treatment with\nLMWH (<_12 months) in cancer-associated thrombosis.369,370 In\nboth studies, the incidence of bleeding complications was higher in\nthe first months and then reached a plateau that remained unchanged\nafter the sixth month. In the absence of conclusive evidence, the deci-\nsion to continue with LMWH or to change to VKA or a NOAC\nshould be made on a case-by-case basis after consideration of the\nsuccess of anticancer therapy, the estimated risk of recurrence of\nVTE, the bleeding risk, and the preference of the patient. Periodic\nreassessment of the risk-to-benefit ratio of continued anticoagulant\ntreatment is mandatory.\nAs mentioned in section 5, venous filters are principally indicated\nwhen anticoagulation is impossible due to active haemorrhage or an\nexcessive bleeding risk. However, the risk of VTE recurrence in the\nabsence of anticoagulation is particularly high in patients with cancer,\nand the insertion of a filter should not delay the initiation of anticoa-\ngulation as soon as it is safe to do so. There is no evidence to support\nthe use of venous filters as an adjunct to anticoagulation treatment in\npatients with cancer.\nA number of studies have reported that a proportion of patients\npresenting with PE in the absence of identifiable risk factors develop\ncancer within the first year after diagnosis.371 Consequently, the opti-\nmal strategy to achieve early diagnosis of these occult cancers was\ninvestigated. Two large randomized trials failed to show that compre-\nhensive CT of the abdomen or 18F deoxy-fluoro-glucose positron\nemission tomography were able to detect more cancers than limited\nscreening in patients with an unprovoked VTE.372,373 Therefore,\nbased on current evidence, the search for occult cancer after an epi-\nsode of VTE may be restricted to careful history taking, physical\nexamination, basic laboratory tests, and a chest X-ray (if no CTPA\nwas performed to diagnose PE).372,374,375\nIn patients with cancer, incidental PE should be managed in the\nsame manner as symptomatic PE, whether it involves segmental or\nmore proximal branches, multiple subsegmental vessels, or a single\nsubsegmental vessel in association with detectable DVT.376,377\n578\nESC Guidelines\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/41/4/543/5556136 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n.......................................................................................................\n9 Pulmonary embolism and\npregnancy\n9.1 Epidemiology and risk factors for\npulmonary embolism in pregnancy\nAcute PE remains one of the leading causes of maternal death in\nhigh-income countries.379,380 For example, in the UK and Ireland,\nthrombosis and thromboembolism were the most common\ncauses of direct maternal death (death resulting from the preg-\nnancy rather than pre-existing conditions) in the triennium\n2013\u000215, resulting in 1.13 mortalities per 100 000 maternities\n(https://www.npeu.ox.ac.uk/mbrrace-uk). VTE risk is higher in\npregnant women compared with non-pregnant women of similar\nage; it increases during pregnancy and reaches a peak during the\npost-partum\nperiod.381\nThe\nbaseline\npregnancy-related\nrisk increases further in the presence of additional VTE risk fac-\ntors, including in vitro fertilization: in a cross-sectional study\nderived from a Swedish registry, the HR for VTE following in vitro\nfertilization was 1.77 (95% CI 1.41\u00022.23) overall and 4.22 (95%\nCI 2.46\u00027.20) during the first trimester.382 Other important and\ncommon risk factors include prior VTE, obesity, medical comor-\nbidities, stillbirth, pre-eclampsia, post-partum haemorrhage, and\ncaesarean section; documented risk assessment is therefore\nessential.383\nThe recommendations provided in these Guidelines are in line\nwith those included in the 2018 ESC Guidelines on the management\nof cardiovascular diseases during pregnancy.384\n9.2 Diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in\npregnancy\n9.2.1 Clinical prediction rules and D-dimers\nDiagnosis of PE during pregnancy can be challenging as symptoms\nfrequently overlap with those of normal pregnancy. The overall\nprevalence of confirmed PE is low among women investigated for\nthe disease, between 2 and 7%.385\u0002388 D-dimer levels continu-\nously increase during pregnancy,389,390 and levels are above the\nthreshold for VTE ‘rule-out’ in almost one-quarter of pregnant\nwomen in the third trimester.390 The results of a multinational\nprospective management study of 441 pregnant women present-\ning to emergency departments with clinically suspected PE sug-\ngest that a diagnostic strategy\u0002based on the assessment of\nclinical\nprobability,\nD-dimer\nmeasurement,\nCUS,\nand\nCTPA\u0002may safely exclude PE in pregnancy.388 In that study, PE\nexclusion on the basis of a negative D-dimer result (without\nimaging) was possible in 11.7% of the 392 women with a non-high\npre-test probability (Geneva) score, a rate that was reduced to\n4.2% in the third trimester.388 A further prospective management\nstudy evaluated a combination of a pregnancy-adapted YEARS\nalgorithm with D-dimer levels in 498 women with suspected PE\nduring pregnancy. PE was ruled out without CTPA in women\ndeemed to be at low PE risk according to the combination of the\nalgorithm and D-dimer results. At 3 months, only one woman\nwith PE excluded on the basis of the algorithm developed a popli-\nteal DVT (0.21%, 95% CI 0.04\u00021.2) and no women developed\nPE.391\n9.2.2 Imaging tests\nA proposed algorithm for the investigation of suspected PE in\nwomen who are pregnant, or <_6 weeks post-partum, is shown in\nFigure 7. Both maternal and foetal radiation exposure are low\nusing modern imaging techniques (Table 12).385,392\u0002398 For V/Q\nscans and CTPA, foetal radiation doses are well below the\nthreshold associated with foetal radiation complications (which\nis 50\u0002100 mSv).399,400 In the past, CTPA has been reported to\ncause high radiation exposure to the breast;395,401 however, CT\ntechnology has evolved, and several techniques can now reduce\nradiation exposure without compromising image quality.

At 3 months, only one woman\nwith PE excluded on the basis of the algorithm developed a popli-\nteal DVT (0.21%, 95% CI 0.04\u00021.2) and no women developed\nPE.391\n9.2.2 Imaging tests\nA proposed algorithm for the investigation of suspected PE in\nwomen who are pregnant, or <_6 weeks post-partum, is shown in\nFigure 7. Both maternal and foetal radiation exposure are low\nusing modern imaging techniques (Table 12).385,392\u0002398 For V/Q\nscans and CTPA, foetal radiation doses are well below the\nthreshold associated with foetal radiation complications (which\nis 50\u0002100 mSv).399,400 In the past, CTPA has been reported to\ncause high radiation exposure to the breast;395,401 however, CT\ntechnology has evolved, and several techniques can now reduce\nradiation exposure without compromising image quality.

Consequently, avoiding PE overdiagnosis in pregnancy is\nas important as not missing a PE diagnosis.\n9.3 Treatment of pulmonary embolism in\npregnancy\nLMWH is the treatment of choice for PE during pregnancy.384 In con-\ntrast to VKAs and NOACs, LMWH does not cross the placenta, and\nconsequently does not confer a risk of foetal haemorrhage or terato-\ngenicity. Moreover, while UFH is also safe in pregnancy, LMWH has\nmore predictable pharmacokinetics and a more favourable risk\nprofile.408\u0002411 Although no RCT has evaluated the optimal dose of\nLMWH for the treatment of PE during pregnancy, currently pub-\nlished data favour similar dosing to non-pregnant patients, either with\no.d. or b.i.d. regimens based on early pregnancy weight.408,410 For the\nmajority of patients receiving LMWH treatment for PE during preg-\nnancy,412,413 it remains uncertain whether using serial measurements\nof plasma anti-activated coagulation factor X activity to guide dosing\nmay be of clinical benefit. It is important to bear in mind that: (i)\nLMWH has a predictable pharmacokinetic profile, (ii) data on optimal\nanti-activated coagulation factor levels are lacking, and (iii) the assay\nitself has limitations.414 In addition, there are no solid data on the clin-\nical benefit vs. harm of frequent, weight-based dose adjustments of\nLMWH during pregnancy. Thus, anti-activated coagulation factor X\nmonitoring may be reserved for specific high-risk circumstances such\nas recurrent VTE, renal impairment, and extremes of body weight.\nThe use of UFH has been associated with heparin-induced throm-\nbocytopenia and bone loss. It remains uncertain whether, and to\nwhat extent, the risk of bone loss is increased with LMWH use. In a\nrecent observational cohort study, in which bone mineral density\nwas measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry 4\u00027 years after\nthe last delivery in 152 women (92 of whom received prolonged\nLMWH during pregnancy), lumbar spine bone mineral density was\nsimilar in LWMH-treated women and controls following adjustment\nfor potential confounders. No osteoporosis or osteoporotic frac-\ntures were reported.415\nFondaparinux may be considered if there is an allergy or adverse\nresponse to LMWH, although solid data are lacking and minor trans-\nplacental passage has been demonstrated.416 VKAs cross the placenta\nand are associated with a well-defined embryopathy during the first\ntrimester. Administration of VKAs in the third trimester can result in\nfoetal and neonatal haemorrhage, as well as placental abruption.\nWarfarin may be associated with central nervous system anomalies\nin the foetus throughout pregnancy. NOACs are contraindicated in\npregnant patients.417\nThe management of labour and delivery requires particular atten-\ntion. In women receiving therapeutic LMWH, strong consideration\nshould be given to planned delivery in collaboration with the multidisci-\nplinary team to avoid the risk of spontaneous labour while fully antico-\nagulated. The incidence of spinal haematoma after regional anaesthesia\nis unknown in pregnant women under anticoagulation treatment. If\nregional analgesia is considered for a woman receiving therapeutic\nLMWH, >_24 h should have elapsed since the last LMWH dose before\ninsertion of a spinal or epidural needle (assuming normal renal function\nand including risk assessment at extremes of body weight).\nIn high-risk situations, for example in patients with recent PE, it is\nrecommended that LMWH be converted to UFH >_36 h prior to\ndelivery. The UFH infusion should be stopped 4 - 6 h prior to antici-\npated delivery and the activated partial thromboplastin time should\nbe normal (i.e. not prolonged) prior to regional anaesthesia.418\nData are limited on the optimal timing of post-partum reinitiation\nof LMWH.419,420 Timing will depend upon the mode of delivery and\nan assessment of the thrombotic vs. bleeding risk by a multidiscipli-\nnary team. LMWH should not be given for >_4 h after removal of the\nepidural catheter; the decision on timing and dose should consider\nwhether the epidural insertion was traumatic, and take into account\nthe risk profile of the woman. For example, an interim dose of a pro-\nphylactic LMWH dose may be considered post-operatively (after\ncaesarean section), once at least 4 h have elapsed since epidural cath-\neter removal, and allowing for an interval of >_8\u000212 h between the\nprophylactic and the next therapeutic dose. Close collaboration\nbetween the obstetrician, the anaesthesiologist, and the attending\nphysician is recommended.\nAnticoagulant treatment should be administered for >_6 weeks\nafter delivery and with a minimum overall treatment duration of 3\nmonths.

For example, an interim dose of a pro-\nphylactic LMWH dose may be considered post-operatively (after\ncaesarean section), once at least 4 h have elapsed since epidural cath-\neter removal, and allowing for an interval of >_8\u000212 h between the\nprophylactic and the next therapeutic dose. Close collaboration\nbetween the obstetrician, the anaesthesiologist, and the attending\nphysician is recommended.\nAnticoagulant treatment should be administered for >_6 weeks\nafter delivery and with a minimum overall treatment duration of 3\nmonths. LMWH and warfarin can be given to breastfeeding mothers;\nthe use of NOACs is not recommended.417\nTable 12\nEstimated amounts of radiation absorbed in\nprocedures used to diagnose pulmonary embolism (based\non various references385,392–398)\nTest\nEstimated\nfoetal radiation\nexposure\n(mGy)a\nEstimated maternal\nradiation exposure\nto breast tissue\n(mGy)a\nChest X-ray\n<0.01\n<0.1\nPerfusion lung scan with\ntechnetium-99m-\nlabelled albumin\nLow dose: \u000340 MBq\nHigh dose: \u0003200 MBq\n0.02\u00020.20\n0.20\u00020.60\n0.16\u00020.5\n1.2\nVentilation lung scan\n0.10\u00020.30\n<0.01\nCTPA\n0.05\u00020.5\n3\u000210\nCTPA = computed tomography pulmonary angiography; mGy = milligray; MBq =\nmegabecquerel; PE = pulmonary embolism.\naIn this section, absorbed radiation dose is expressed in mGy to reﬂect the radia-\ntion exposure to single organs, or the foetus, as a result of various diagnostic\ntechniques.

A recent systematic review included 127\ncases of severe PE during pregnancy (and until 6 weeks post-partum)\ntreated with thrombolysis, thrombectomy, and/or ECMO.421 Both\nhigh- and intermediate-risk PE cases were included, and 23% of\nwomen experienced cardiac arrest. Reported survival rates were 94\nand 86% following thrombolysis and surgical thrombectomy, respec-\ntively; however, these favourable rates may reflect reporting bias.\nFollowing thrombolysis, major bleeding occurred in 18 and 58% of\ncases during pregnancy and in the post-partum period, respec-\ntively.421 Finally, foetal deaths occurred in 12 and 20% of the cases\nfollowing\nthrombolysis\nand\nthrombectomy,\nrespectively.421\nThrombolytic treatment should not be used peri-partum, except in\nthe setting of life-threatening PE. Typically, UFH is used in the acute\ntreatment of high-risk PE.\nAlthough the indications for vena cava filters are similar to those\nfor non-pregnant patients (discussed in section 6), there is limited\nexperience with their use in pregnancy and the risk associated with\nthe procedure may be increased.\nSuggestions for the anticoagulation management of PE in specific\nclinical situations (also) related to pregnancy, for which conclusive\nevidence is lacking, are presented in Supplementary Data Table 9.\n9.3.1 Role of a multidisciplinary pregnancy heart team\nA team of multidisciplinary colleagues should collaborate in the plan-\nning of ante-, peri-, and post-partum care pathways for women with\ncardiovascular diseases, including PE. As many members as possible\nof this team should have expertise in the management of PE during\npregnancy and the post-partum period. Jointly agreed, written care\npathways should be available (if timelines permit) for effective com-\nmunication (an example is shown in Figure 7).\n9.4 Amniotic fluid embolism\nAmniotic fluid embolism (AFE) is a rare condition that occurs dur-\ning pregnancy or shortly after delivery. It remains one of the leading\ncauses of direct maternal death (i.e. death resulting from the preg-\nnancy rather than from pre-existing conditions) in high-income\ncountries.422 Diagnosis of AFE is challenging, being primarily a clini-\ncal diagnosis of exclusion. Awareness of AFE, prompt diagnosis, and\naggressive life support are of critical importance. AFE is character-\nized by unexplained sudden cardiovascular or respiratory deterio-\nration,\noften\naccompanied\nby\ndisseminated\nintravascular\ncoagulation,422 and occurring during pregnancy or after deliv-\nery.423,424 The reported incidence is approximately 2\u00027 per 100\n000 maternities, with a mortality rate of 0.5\u00026 deaths per 100 000\ndeliveries.422,425,426 Reported case fatality rates vary, reflecting the\nchallenges in making the diagnosis and the rarity of AFE. In a retro-\nspective Californian study including more than 3.5 million deliveries,\na case fatality rate of 13% was reported, as in other US and\nCanadian studies.425 Similarly, a case fatality rate of 19% was\nreported in a recent prospective UK population-based study with\nvalidated case criteria.422 Recent literature have suggested that risk\nfactors for AFE may include pre-existing cardiac, cerebrovascular,\nand renal disorders, placenta previa, polyhydramnios, stillbirth, cho-\nrioamnionitis, hypertensive disorders, instrumental delivery, and\ncaesarean section.422,425 Management of AFE is supportive, and\nbased on high-quality emergency care following the recognition\nand diagnosis of the condition, with prompt treatment of bleeding\nand coagulopathy.423 Awareness of AFE should be integral to the\neducation of involved physicians and to emergency algorithms.\n9.5 Recommendations for pulmonary embolism in\npregnancy\nRecommendations\nClassa\nLevelb\nDiagnosis\nFormal diagnostic assessment with validated\nmethods is recommended if PE is suspected dur-\ning pregnancy or in the post-partum period.388,391\nI\nB\nD-dimer measurement and clinical prediction\nrules should be considered to rule out PE during\npregnancy or the post-partum period.388,391\nIIa\nB\nIn a pregnant patient with suspected PE (par-\nticularly if she has symptoms of DVT), venous\nCUS should be considered to avoid unneces-\nsary irradiation.388\nIIa\nB\nPerfusion scintigraphy or CTPA (with a low-radi-\nation dose protocol) should be considered to\nrule out suspected PE in pregnant women; CTPA\nshould be considered as the ﬁrst-line option if\nthe chest X-ray is abnormal.385,386\nIIa\nC\nTreatment\nA therapeutic, ﬁxed dose of LMWH based on\nearly pregnancy body weight is the recom-\nmended therapy for PE in the majority of preg-\nnant women without haemodynamic\ninstability.408,410\nI\nB\nThrombolysis or surgical embolectomy should\nbe considered for pregnant women with high-\nrisk PE.421\nIIa\nC\nInsertion of a spinal or epidural needle is not rec-\nommended, unless >_24 h have passed since the\nlast therapeutic dose of LMWH.\nIII\nC\nAdministration of LMWH is not recom-\nmended within 4 h of removal of an epidural\ncatheter.\nIII\nC\nNOACs are not recommended during preg-\nnancy or lactation.\nIII\nC\nAmniotic ﬂuid embolism\nAmniotic ﬂuid embolism should be considered\nin a pregnant or post-partum woman with\notherwise unexplained cardiac arrest, sus-\ntained hypotension, or respiratory deteriora-\ntion, especially if accompanied by\ndisseminated intravascular\ncoagulation.422,425,426\nIIa\nC\nCTPA = computed tomography pulmonary angiography; CUS = compression ultraso-\nnography; DVT = deep vein thrombosis; LMWH = low-molecular weight heparin;\nNOACs = non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants; PE = pulmonary embolism.\naClass of recommendation.\nbLevel of evidence.\n582\nESC Guidelines\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/41/4/543/5556136 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n.............................................................................................................................................................................\n10 Long-term sequelae of\npulmonary embolism\nThe patency of the pulmonary arterial bed is restored in the majority\nof PE survivors within the first few months following the acute epi-\nsode; therefore, no routine follow-up CTPA imaging is needed in\nsuch patients treated for PE.427 However, in other patients, thrombi\nbecome persistent and organized, which in rare cases may result in\nCTEPH, a potentially life-threatening obstructing vasculopathy. The\nrarity of this condition is in contrast to the relatively large number of\npatients who report persisting dyspnoea or poor physical perform-\nance over several months after acute PE. Thus, the aims of an efficient\nfollow-up strategy after PE should be to: (i) provide appropriate care\n(exercise rehabilitation, treatment of comorbidity, behavioural edu-\ncation, and modification of risk factors) to patients with persisting\nsymptoms, and (ii) ensure early detection of CTEPH to refer the\npatient for further diagnostic workup and specific treatment.\n10.1 Persisting symptoms and functional\nlimitation after pulmonary embolism\nCohort studies conducted over the past decade (summarized in Klok\net al.428) have revealed that persisting or deteriorating dyspnoea, and\npoor physical performance, are frequently present 6 months to 3\nyears after an acute PE episode. The proportion of patients claiming\nthat their health status is worse at 6 month follow-up than it was at\nthe time of PE diagnosis varies widely, ranging between 20 and\n75%.429\u0002431 The following baseline parameters and findings could be\nidentified as predictors of exertional dyspnoea at long-term follow-\nup after PE: advanced age, cardiac or pulmonary comorbidity, higher\nbody mass index, and history of smoking;429 higher systolic PAP and\nRV dysfunction at diagnosis;430,432,433 and residual pulmonary vascular\nobstruction at discharge.434\nMore recently, a prospective cohort study enrolled 100 patients at\nfive Canadian hospitals between 2010 and 2013, and followed them\nover 1 year.435 As many as 47% of the patients had reduced maximal\naerobic capacity, defined as peak oxygen consumption <80% of the\npredicted value on cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET). This\nfunctional outcome was associated with significantly worse generic\nhealth-related quality of life and dyspnoea scores, as well as with a sig-\nnificantly reduced 6 min walk distance.435 Independent predictors of\nreduced functional exercise capacity and quality of life over time\nincluded female sex, higher body mass index, history of lung disease,\nhigher pulmonary artery systolic pressures on the 10 day echocardio-\ngram, and higher main pulmonary artery diameter on the baseline\nCTPA.436 Of note, pulmonary function tests and echocardiographic\nresults at follow-up were largely within normal limits, both in patients\nwith and without reduced maximal aerobic capacity.435 Lack of an\nassociation between exercise impairment, and persistent RV dilation\nor dysfunction, was also reported by a study of 20 survivors of mas-\nsive or submassive PE.437\nTaken together, older and more recent cohort studies have sug-\ngested that muscle deconditioning, particularly in the presence of\nexcess body weight and cardiopulmonary comorbidity, is largely\nresponsible for the frequently reported dyspnoea and signs of exer-\ncise limitation after acute PE. This also means that, at least in the\nmajority of cases, poor physical performance after PE does not\nappear to be attributable to ‘large’ residual thrombi, or persisting/\nprogressive PH and RV dysfunction. Ongoing prospective studies in\nlarge numbers of patients may help to better identify predictors of\nfunctional and/or haemodynamic impairment after acute PE, and their\npossible implications for shaping follow-up programmes.438\nAs mentioned in section 6, it remains unclear whether early reper-\nfusion treatment, notably thrombolysis, has an impact on clinical\nsymptoms, functional limitation, or persistent (or new-onset) PH at\nlong-term follow-up after PE. Consequently, prevention of long-term\nPE sequelae is, at present, no justification for thrombolytic treatment\nin the acute phase of PE.\n10.2 Chronic thromboembolic\npulmonary hypertension\n10.2.1 Epidemiology, pathophysiology, and natural\nhistory\nCTEPH is a disease caused by the persistent obstruction of pulmo-\nnary arteries by organized thrombi, leading to flow redistribution and\nsecondary remodelling of the pulmonary microvascular bed. CTEPH\nhas been reported with a cumulative incidence of between 0.1 and\n9.1% in the first 2 years after a symptomatic PE event; the large mar-\ngin of error is due to referral bias, the paucity of early symptoms, and\nthe difficulty of differentiating acute PE from symptoms of pre-\nexisting CTEPH.439,440 A prospective, multicentre, observational\nscreening survey for the detection of CTEPH included patients with\nacute PE from 11 centres in Switzerland, from March 2009 to\nNovember 2016. Screening for possible CTEPH was performed at 6,\n12, and 24 months using a stepwise algorithm that included a phone-\nbased dyspnoea survey, TTE, right heart catheterization, and radio-\nlogical confirmation of CTEPH. Of 508 patients assessed for CTEPH\nscreening over 2 years, CTEPH incidence following PE was 3.7 per\n1000 patient-years, with a 2 year cumulative incidence of 0.79%.441 In\nGermany, the incidence of CTEPH in 2016 was estimated at 5.7 per\nmillion adult population.442\nThe hallmark of CTEPH is fibrotic transformation of a pulmonary\narterial thrombus, causing fixed mechanical obstruction of pulmo-\nnary arteries and leading to overflow of the open pulmonary arte-\nrial bed. Together with collateral supply from systemic arteries\ndownstream of pulmonary arterial occlusions, this contributes to\nmicrovascular remodelling causing a progressive increase in\nPVR.443 Owing to this complex pathophysiology, there is no clear\ncorrelation between the degree of mechanical obstruction found at\nimaging and haemodynamics, which can deteriorate in the absence\nof recurrent PE.444\nTwo historical trials assessed survival in patients with CTEPH\nbefore the availability of surgical treatment. In both studies, mean\nPAP >30 mmHg was related to poor survival, similar to that reported\nfor idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension.445,446\nThe most frequently cited risk factors and predisposing conditions\nfor CTEPH are shown in Table 13. In an international registry, a his-\ntory of acute PE was reported by 75% of patients.447 Associated con-\nditions\nand\ncomorbidities\nincluded\nthrombophilic\ndisorders,\nparticularly antiphospholipid antibody syndrome and high coagulation\nfactor VIII levels, cancer, a history of splenectomy, inflammatory\nbowel disease, ventriculo-atrial shunts, and infection of chronic i.v.\nlines and devices such as implantable pacemakers.\nESC Guidelines\n583\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/41/4/543/5556136 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n....................................................................................................\n10.2.2 Clinical presentation and diagnosis\nDiagnosing CTEPH is difficult. Algorithms for predicting450 or ruling\nout CTEPH451,452 are limited by a lack of specificity. The clinical char-\nacteristics of patients enrolled in an international CTEPH registry\nhave shown that the median age at diagnosis is 63 years and that both\nsexes are equally affected; paediatric cases are rare.447 Clinical symp-\ntoms and signs are non-specific or absent in early CTEPH, with signs\nof right heart failure only becoming evident in advanced disease.\nThus, early diagnosis remains a challenge in CTEPH, with a median\ntime of 14 months between symptom onset and diagnosis in expert\ncentres.453 When present, the clinical symptoms of CTEPH may\nresemble those of acute PE or of pulmonary arterial hypertension; in\nthe latter context, oedema and haemoptysis occur more often in\nCTEPH, while syncope is more common in pulmonary arterial\nhypertension.453\nThe diagnosis of CTEPH is based on findings obtained after at least\n3 months of effective anticoagulation, to distinguish this condition\nfrom acute PE. The diagnosis requires a mean PAP of >_25 mmHg\nalong with a pulmonary arterial wedge pressure of <_15 mmHg, docu-\nmented at right heart catheterization in a patient with mismatched\nperfusion defects on V/Q lung scan. Specific diagnostic signs for\nCTEPH on multidetector CT angiography or conventional pulmo-\nnary cineangiography include ring-like stenoses, webs, slits, and\nchronic total occlusions.289\nSome patients may present with normal pulmonary haemodynam-\nics at rest despite symptomatic disease. If other causes of exercise\nlimitation are excluded, these patients are considered as having\nchronic thromboembolic disease (CTED). Identification of patients\nwith chronic thromboembolism without PH, who may have an indi-\ncation for surgical or interventional treatment, requires particular\nexpertise and should be done in CTEPH referral centres. Among\n1019 patients who were submitted to pulmonary endarterectomy\n(PEA) in a UK referral centre, 42 patients did not have pulmonary\nhypertension at rest but showed functional improvement after the\noperation.454\nPlanar V/Q lung scan is a suitable first-line imaging modality for\nCTEPH as it has 96\u000297% sensitivity and 90\u000295% specificity for the\ndiagnosis.455 SPECT seems less sensitive than planar V/Q scanning if\nassessed at a level of individual segmental arteries, but it is unlikely to\nmiss clinically relevant CTEPH in an individual patient. In contrast to\nCTEPH, abnormal mismatched perfusion defects sometimes found in\npulmonary arterial hypertension and pulmonary veno-occlusive dis-\nease typically have a non-segmental pattern.\nCTPA is gaining ground as a diagnostic modality in CTEPH,456 but\nit should not be used as a stand-alone test to exclude the disease.455\nNewer diagnostic tests include dual-energy CT, which allows the\nsimultaneous assessment of patency of the pulmonary arteries and of\nlung perfusion, probably at a cost of some increase in radiation deliv-\nered to the patient. Magnetic resonance imaging of the pulmonary\nvasculature is still considered inferior to CT.457 Cone-beam CT,458\nangioscopy,459 intravascular ultrasound, and optical coherence\ntomography are more suitable for the characterization of lesions dur-\ning interventional treatment than for diagnosis.

It requires deep hypothermia and intermit-\ntent circulatory arrest, without a need for cerebral perfusion.460,461\nIn-hospital mortality is currently as low as 4.7%462 and is even lower\nin high-volume single centres.463 The majority of patients experience\nsubstantial\nrelief\nfrom\nsymptoms\nand\nnear-normalization\nof\nhaemodynamics.461\u0002464 Owing to the complexity of both the surgical\ntechnique and peri-procedural management, PEA is performed in\nspecialized centres. Eligibility for surgery requires a decision taken\nduring a dedicated meeting of a multidisciplinary CTEPH team includ-\ning experienced surgeons for PEA, interventional radiologists or car-\ndiologists, radiologists experienced in pulmonary vascular imaging,\nand clinicians with expertise in PH. The CTEPH team should confirm\nthe diagnosis, assess the surgical accessibility of chronic post-\nthrombotic obstructions (‘surgical operability’), and consider the risks\nrelated to comorbidities (‘medical operability’). The operability of\npatients with CTEPH is determined by multiple factors that cannot\neasily be standardized. These are related to the suitability of the\npatient, the expertise of the surgical team, and available resources.\nGeneral criteria include pre-operative New York Heart Association\n(NYHA) functional class and the surgical accessibility of thrombi in\nthe main, lobar, or segmental pulmonary arteries.462 Advanced age\nper se is no contraindication for surgery. There is no haemodynamic\nthreshold or measure of RV dysfunction that can be considered to\npreclude PEA.\nData from the international CTEPH registry, set up in 27 centres\nto evaluate the long-term outcome and outcome predictors in 679\noperated and not-operated patients, showed estimated survival at 3\nyears of 89% in operated and 70% in not-operated patients.465\nMortality was associated with NYHA functional class, RA pressure,\nand a history of cancer.465 In this prospective registry, the long-term\nprognosis of operated patients was better than the outcome of not-\noperated patients.465 Additional correlates of mortality were bridging\ntherapy with pulmonary vasodilators, post-operative PH, surgical\ncomplications, and additional cardiac procedures in operated\npatients, and comorbidities such as coronary disease, left heart fail-\nure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in not-operated\npatients.465 A recent report identified mean PAP >_38 mmHg and\nPVR >_425 dyn*s*cm-5 as determinants of poor prognosis in survivors\nof surgical treatment for CTEPH.466\nPost-operative ECMO is recommended as the standard of care in\nPEA centres.461 Early post-operative reperfusion oedema may\nrequire veno-arterial ECMO, and severe persistent PH may be\nbridged to emergency lung transplantation with ECMO. After PEA,\npatients should be followed in CTEPH centres to exclude persistent\nor recurrent PH, with at least one haemodynamic assessment to be\nconsidered at 6\u000212 months after the intervention.\n10.2.4 Balloon pulmonary angioplasty\nOver the past decade, balloon pulmonary angioplasty (BPA) has\nemerged as an effective treatment for technically inoperable CTEPH.\nIt allows dilatation of obstructions down to subsegmental vessels,\nwhich are inaccessible to surgery. BPA is a stepwise procedure\nrequiring several (usually 4\u000210) separate sessions. This is necessary\nto engage all under-perfused lung segments, while limiting the con-\ntrast burden and radiation delivered per session. Navigation in distal\npulmonary arteries requires particular expertise, as the complexity\nand individual variability of the pulmonary arterial tree greatly\nexceeds that of other vascular beds. Complications include wire- and\nballoon-induced injury, which may result in intrapulmonary bleeding,\nhaemoptysis, and reperfusion lung injury. Usually, bleeding resolves\nspontaneously, but sometimes it has to be controlled by transient\nballoon inflation proximal to the site of perforation; in rare cases it\nrequires embolization. Mild hypoxaemia is frequent and can be con-\ntrolled by oxygen delivery. Mechanical ventilation or ECMO is rarely\nneeded.\nThe largest published registry to date included 249 patients with a\nmean age of 61.5 years, who were treated with BPA between 2004\nand 2013 in seven Japanese centres.467 Mean PAP decreased from 43\nto 24 mmHg after terminating BPA sessions, and this result was main-\ntained in 196 patients who underwent follow-up right heart catheter-\nization. Complications occurred in 36% of the patients, including\npulmonary injury (18%), haemoptysis (14%), and pulmonary artery\nperforation (2.9%). After BPA, 30 day mortality was 2.6% and overall\nsurvival was 97% at 1 year.467\nWhile most of the BPA procedures are performed in technically\ninoperable patients, this method has also been used for sequential\ntreatment for PH persisting after PEA. Few ‘rescue’ BPA interven-\ntions performed in unstable patients remaining on ECMO after PEA\nwere ineffective.468\n10.2.5 Pharmacological treatment\nOptimal medical treatment for CTEPH consists of anticoagulants, as\nwell as diuretics and oxygen in cases of heart failure or hypoxaemia.\nLifelong oral anticoagulation with VKAs is recommended, and also\nafter successful PEA or BPA. No data exist on the efficacy and safety\nof NOACs.\nPulmonary microvascular disease in CTEPH has provided the\nrationale for also testing drugs that have been approved for pulmo-\nnary arterial hypertension for this indication. Based on available data,\nmedical treatment of CTEPH with targeted therapy is now justified\nfor technically inoperable patients,469,470 as well as for patients with\nPH persisting after PEA.469 To date, the only drug approved for inop-\nerable CTEPH or persistent/recurrent PH after PEA is riociguat, an\noral stimulator of soluble guanylate cyclase.469 In a prospective\nrandomized trial of 261 patients with inoperable CTEPH or persis-\ntent/recurrent PH after PEA, treatment with riociguat significantly\nincreased 6 min walking distance and reduced PVR.469 In a similar\npopulation of 157 patients, the dual endothelin antagonist bosentan\nshowed a positive effect on haemodynamics, but no improvement\nwas observed in exercise capacity and the primary outcome was not\nmet.471 Another dual endothelin antagonist, macitentan, was found\nto significantly improve PVR and 6 min walking distance compared to\nplacebo in a phase II trial focusing on inoperable patients with\nCTEPH.470 Currently, riociguat is being tested in trials addressing its\nefficacy and safety: (i) as bridging therapy for patients scheduled to\nundergo PEA (NCT 03273257) and (ii) in comparison to BPA (NCT\n02634203).\nOverall, the effects on clinical worsening of drugs tested with\nRCTs in patients with CTEPH have not yet been clarified.\nFurthermore, no data exist on medical treatment in technically oper-\nable patients with prohibitive comorbidities or those refusing surgery.\nESC Guidelines\n585\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/41/4/543/5556136 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n......................\nOff-label combination of drugs approved for pulmonary arterial\nhypertension has been proposed for CTEPH patients presenting with\nsevere haemodynamic compromise, but only limited prospective\ndata are available to date.470\nMedical therapy is not indicated in symptomatic survivors of acute\nPE with documented post-thrombotic obstructions but an absence\nof PH at right heart catheterization at rest (CTED).\n10.3 Strategies for patient follow-up after\npulmonary embolism\nFigure 8 displays a proposed follow-up strategy for survivors of acute\nPE following discharge from hospital.

The severity of dysp-\nnoea can be assessed using the Medical Research Council scale;160\nalternatively, the World Health Organization functional class can be\ndetermined (Supplementary Data Table 16).289\nIn patients complaining of persisting dyspnoea and poor physical\nperformance, TTE should be considered as the next step to assess\nthe probability of (chronic) PH and thus possible CTEPH. The cri-\nteria and levels of PH probability are defined by current ESC\nGuidelines,289 and are listed in Supplementary Data Tables 17 and\n18. Patients with a high echocardiographic probability of PH, or\nthose with intermediate probability combined with elevated NT-\nproBNP levels or risk factors/predisposing conditions for CTEPH,\nsuch as those listed in Table 13, should be considered for a V/Q\nscan.\nIf mismatched perfusion defects are found on the V/Q scan,\nreferral to a PH or CTEPH expert centre for further diagnostic\nworkup is indicated. If, on the other hand, the V/Q scan is normal\nand the patient’s symptoms remain unexplained, CPET may be\nperformed. By providing evidence of reduced maximal aerobic\ncapacity, CPET supports the need for further follow-up visits and\nhelps to identify candidates for pulmonary rehabilitation, exer-\ncise, or weight-reduction programmes.435,436 CPET may also be\nhelpful in patients with suspected CTEPH and coexisting left\nheart and/or respiratory disease; in such cases, it can help to\nestablish the main limiting factor and thus set priorities for the\ntreatment strategy.472\nFor patients who report as free of dyspnoea or functional limita-\ntion at 3\u00026-month follow-up after acute PE but have risk factors/pre-\ndisposing conditions for CTEPH (Table 13), further follow-up visits\nmay be scheduled and the patient must be advised to return if symp-\ntoms appear. Alternatively, TTE may be considered to assess the\nprobability of PH (Figure 8).\nApart from the recommended screening and diagnostic measures,\nan integrated model of patient care after PE should be provided, tak-\ning into consideration the infrastructure and possibilities offered by\neach country’s health system. The model should include appropri-\nately qualified nurses, interdisciplinary working with physicians in the\ncare of both in-hospital and ambulatory PE patients, standardized\ntreatment protocols adapted to the capacities of each hospital, and\nbidirectional referral pathways between general practice and the hos-\npital. Such models ensure smooth transitions between hospital spe-\ncialists and practitioners; provide continuity, and easy access to care\nalong with information and education; and respect the patients’ pref-\nerences, and those of their families and social environment. In this\ncontext, nurse-led care models to deliver follow-up have been\nshown to be effective after acute coronary syndrome,473 in primary\ncare-based management of chronic diseases,474 and in community\nbased self-management initiatives.475 A recently published study\ninvestigated the care of 42 patients followed at a pulmonary arterial\nhypertension (PAH)/CTEPH nurse-led outpatient clinic and showed\npositive results.476 During patient follow-up visits, appropriately\nqualified nurses screen for signs and symptoms indicating VTE recur-\nrence or complications of treatment, and assess adherence to medi-\ncation. Nurses work collaboratively with patients using behavioural\nframeworks and motivational interviewing, to identify and modify\nassociated risk factors (smoking cessation, diet, physical activity, and\nexercise). In addition, they promote self-management skills such as\nthe use of compression stockings, safe increase in mobility, increased\nawareness of signs of recurrence, or complications.\n11 Non-thrombotic pulmonary\nembolism\nThis section is included in the Supplementary Data available online\non the EHJ and ESC websites (www.escardio.org/guidelines).\n12 Key messages\nThe ESC Task Force has selected 10 simple key messages and rules\nto guide physicians in the diagnosis and management of PE:\n(1)\nIn patients presenting with haemodynamic instability, perform bed-\nside TTE as a fast, immediate step to differentiate suspected high-\nrisk PE from other acute life-threatening situations.\n10.4 Recommendations for follow-up after acute pulmo-\nnary embolism\nRecommendations\nClassa\nLevelb\nRoutine clinical evaluationc of patients 3\u00026\nmonths after the acute PE episode is\nrecommended.288,352,353,437\nI\nB\nAn integrated model of patient care after PE\n(involving hospital specialists, appropriately\nqualiﬁed nurses, and primary care physicians)\nis recommended to ensure optimal transition\nfrom hospital to community care.\nI\nC\nIn symptomatic patients with mismatched per-\nfusion defects persisting on V/Q scand beyond\n3 months after acute PE, referral to a PH/\nCTEPH expert centre is recommended, after\ntaking into account the results of echocardiog-\nraphy, natriuretic peptide levels, and/or\nCPET.477\nI\nC\nFurther diagnostic evaluatione should be con-\nsidered in patients with persistent or new-\nonset dyspnoea/exercise limitation after PE.\nIIa\nC\nFurther diagnostic evaluatione may be consid-\nered in asymptomatic patients with risk factors\nfor CTEPH.f 447\u0002449,478\nIIb\nC\nCPET = cardiopulmonary exercise testing; CT = computed tomography; CTEPH\n= Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension; PE = pulmonary embolism;\nPH = pulmonary hypertension; V/Q = ventilation/perfusion (lung scintigraphy).\naClass of recommendation.\nbLevel of evidence.\ncFor symptoms suggesting recurrence, bleeding, malignancy, or persistent or\nnew-onset exercise limitation, and to decide on extension of anticoagulant\ntreatment.\ndAlternatively, dual-energy CT may be used, if appropriate expertise and resour-\nces are available on-site.\neAs proposed in the algorithm shown in Figure 8.\nfRisk factors and predisposing conditions for CTEPH are listed in Table 13.\nESC Guidelines\n587\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/41/4/543/5556136 by guest on 14 January 2026",

They help to avoid unnecessary, expensive, and\npotentially harmful imaging tests and exposure to ionizing\nradiation.\n(4)\nIf the CTPA report suggests single subsegmental PE, consider\nthe possibility of a false-positive finding. Discuss the findings again\nwith the radiologist and/or seek a second opinion to avoid misdiag-\nnosis,\nand\nunnecessary,\npotentially\nharmful\nanticoagulation\ntreatment.\n(5)\nConfirmation of PE in a patient, without haemodynamic instability,\nmust be followed by further risk assessment involving clinical find-\nings, evaluation of the size and/or function of the RV, and labora-\ntory biomarkers as appropriate. This information will help you to\ndecide on the need for reperfusion treatment or monitoring for\npatients at elevated risk, or consider the option of early discharge\nand continuation of anticoagulation on an ambulatory basis for\npatients at low risk.\n(6)\nAs soon as you diagnose (or strongly suspect) high-risk PE, select\nthe best reperfusion option (systemic thrombolysis, surgical\nembolectomy, or catheter-directed treatment) considering the\npatient’s risk profile, and the resources and expertise available at\nyour hospital. For patients with intermediate-high-risk PE, reperfu-\nsion is not first-line treatment, but you should prospectively plan\nthe management strategy with your team to have a contingency\nplan ready if the situation deteriorates.\n(7)\nPrefer anticoagulation with a NOAC over the ‘traditional’\nLMWH-VKA regimen unless the patient has contraindication(s) to\nthis type of drug.\n(8)\nAlways remember that, with the exception of acute PE provoked\nby a strong transient/reversible risk factor, there is a lifelong risk of\nVTE recurrence after a first episode of PE. Consequently, re-\nexamine the patient after the first 3 - 6 months of anticoagulation,\nweigh the benefits vs. risks of continuing treatment, and decide on\nthe extension and dose of anticoagulant therapy, also considering\nthe patient’s preference. Remember to recommend regular\nfollow-up examinations, e.g. at yearly intervals.\n(9)\nIf you suspect PE in a pregnant patient, consider diagnostic path-\nways and algorithms including CTPA or V/Q lung scan, which can\nbe used safely during pregnancy.\n(10)\nAfter acute PE, patients should not be lost to follow-up. Apart\nfrom checking for possible signs of VTE recurrence, cancer, or\nbleeding complications of anticoagulation, ask the patient if there is\npersisting or new-onset dyspnoea or functional limitation. If yes,\nimplement a staged diagnostic workup to exclude CTEPH or\nchronic thromboembolic disease, and to detect/treat comorbidity\nor ‘simple’ deconditioning. Follow-up imaging is not routinely rec-\nommended in an asymptomatic patient, but it may be considered\nin patients with risk factors for development of CTEPH.\n13 Gaps in the evidence\nDiagnosis\n• The optimal method to adjust (based on the patient’s age or in\ncombination with clinical probability) the D-dimer threshold, per-\nmitting the exclusion of PE while reducing the number of\nunnecessary imaging tests to a minimum, remains to be\ndetermined.\n• The diagnostic value and clinical significance of isolated subseg-\nmental contrast-filling defects in the modern CTPA era remain\ncontroversial.\n• No robust data exist to guide the decision on whether to treat\nincidental PE with anticoagulants compared with a strategy of\nwatchful waiting.\n• For patients presenting with non-traumatic chest pain, the bene-\nfits vs. risks of ‘triple rule-out’ (for coronary artery disease, PE,\nand aortic dissection) CT angiography need further evaluation\nbefore such an approach can be routinely recommended.\nAssessment of pulmonary embolism severity and the risk\nof early death\n• The optimal, clinically most relevant combination (and cut-off lev-\nels) of clinical and biochemical predictors of early PE-related\ndeath remain to be determined, particularly with regard to identi-\nfying possible candidates for reperfusion treatment among\npatients with intermediate-risk PE.\n• The need for assessment of the RV status in addition to clinical\nparameters, to classify a patient with acute symptomatic PE as\nbeing at low vs. intermediate risk, needs to be confirmed by fur-\nther prospective management (cohort) studies.\nTreatment in the acute phase\n• The clinical benefits vs. risks of reduced-dose thrombolysis and\ncatheter-based reperfusion modalities in patients with intermedia-\nte-high-risk PE should be evaluated in prospective randomized\ntrials.\n• The place of ECMO in the management of acute high-risk PE\nawaits support by additional evidence from prospective manage-\nment (cohort) studies.\n• The optimal anticoagulant drug(s) and regimen in patients with\nrenal insufficiency and CrCl <30 mL/min remain unclear.\n• The criteria for selecting patients for early discharge and\noutpatient\ntreatment\nof PE, and particularly the need\nfor assessment of the RV status with imaging methods\nand/or laboratory markers in addition to calculating a clinical\nscore, need to be further validated in prospective cohort\nstudies.\nChronic treatment and prevention of recurrence\n• The clinical value and the possible therapeutic implications of\nmodels or scores assessing the risk of VTE recurrence, and the\nrisk of bleeding under anticoagulation, need to be revisited in the\nNOAC era.\n• The effectiveness of extended treatment with a reduced dose, or\napixaban or rivaroxaban, should be confirmed in patients with a\nhigh risk of recurrent PE.\n588\nESC Guidelines\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/41/4/543/5556136 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n...................................................\n• The evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of NOACs for\nthe treatment of PE in patients with cancer needs to be\nextended by further studies.\n• In patients with cancer, the anticoagulant regimen and dose after\nthe first 6 months should be clarified and prospectively tested.\n• The optimal time for discontinuing anticoagulant treatment after\nan episode of acute PE in patients with cancer is yet to be\ndetermined.\nPulmonary embolism and pregnancy\n• Diagnostic algorithms for PE in pregnancy, using modern radio-\nlogical imaging techniques and low radiation doses, need to be\nprospectively tested in adequately powered cohort studies.\n• Controversy persists on the optimal LMWH dose and regimen\nfor the treatment of PE during pregnancy.\n• NOACs are not allowed in pregnancy. However, if exposure to\nthese drugs occurs during pregnancy despite this warning, any\npossible effects on the foetus should be recorded to provide\nmore precise information on the risks and complications of these\ndrugs, and adapt the instructions to physicians in the future.\nLong-term sequelae of pulmonary embolism\n• The optimal follow-up strategy, including the spectrum of diag-\nnostic tests that may be necessary, in patients with persisting\nsymptoms and functional limitation after acute PE needs to be\ndefined and prospectively validated.\n• In the absence of persisting symptoms or functional limitation\nafter acute PE, the criteria for identifying patients whose risk of\ndeveloping CTEPH may be sufficiently high to justify further diag-\nnostic workup require further elaboration and validation in pro-\nspective cohort studies.\n14 ‘What to do’ and ‘what not to\ndo’ messages from the Guidelines\nDiagnosis\nClassa\nIn suspected high-risk PE, perform bedside echocardiography or emergency CTPA (depending on availability and clinical circumstan-\nces) for diagnosis.\nI\nIn suspected high-risk PE, initiate intravenous anticoagulation with UFH without delay, including a weight-adjusted bolus injection.\nI\nIn suspected PE without haemodynamic instability, use validated diagnostic criteria.\nI\nIn suspected PE without haemodynamic instability, initiate anticoagulation in case of high or intermediate clinical probability, while\ndiagnostic workup is in progress.\nI\nBase the diagnostic strategy on clinical probability, using either clinical judgement or a validated prediction rule.\nI\nMeasure D-dimers in plasma, preferably with a highly sensitive assay, in outpatients/emergency department patients with low or inter-\nmediate clinical probability, or who are PE-unlikely.\nI\nReject the diagnosis of PE (without further testing) if CTPA is normal in a patient with low or intermediate clinical probability, or if\nthe patient is PE-unlikely.\nI\nReject the diagnosis of PE (without further testing) if the perfusion lung scan is normal.\nI\nAccept the diagnosis of PE if CTPA shows a segmental or more proximal ﬁlling defect in a patient with intermediate or high clinical\nprobability.\nI\nAccept the diagnosis of VTE if CUS shows a proximal DVT in a patient with clinical suspicion of PE.\nI\nDo not measure D-dimers in patients with high clinical probability, as a normal result does not safely exclude PE.\nIII\nDo not perform CT venography as an adjunct to CTPA.\nIII\nDo not perform MRA to rule out PE.\nIII\nRisk assessment\nStratify patients with suspected or conﬁrmed PE, based on the presence of haemodynamic instability, to identify those at high risk of\nearly mortality.\nI\nIn patients without haemodynamic instability, further stratify PE into intermediate- and low-risk categories.\nI\nTreatment in the acute phase\nAdminister systemic thrombolytic therapy to patients with high-risk PE.\nI\nSurgical pulmonary embolectomy for patients with high-risk PE, in whom recommended thrombolysis is contraindicated or has failed.\nI\nIf anticoagulation is initiated parenterally in a patient without haemodynamic instability, prefer LMWH or fondaparinux over UFH.\nI\nContinued\nESC Guidelines\n589\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/41/4/543/5556136 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n....................................................\n15 Supplementary data\nSupplementary Data with additional Web Supplementary Tables\ncomplementing the full text, as well as section 11 on non-thrombotic\nPE, are available on the European Heart Journal website and via the\nESC website at www.escardio.org/guidelines.\n16 Appendix\nAuthor/Task Force Member Affiliations:\nCecilia Becattini, Internal and Cardiovascular Medicine, University\nof Perugia, Perugia, Italy; He´ctor Bueno, Centro Nacional de\nInvestigaciones Cardiovasculares, Madrid, Spain; and Cardiology,\nHospital Universitario 12 de Octubre & iþ12 Research Institute,\nMadrid, Spain; CIBERCV, Madrid, Spain; Geert-Jan Geersing, Julius\nCenter for Health Sciences and Primary Care, University Medical\nCenter Utrecht, Utrecht University, Utrecht, Netherlands; Veli-\nPekka Harjola, Emergency Medicine, Department of Emergency\nMedicine and Services, Helsinki University, Helsinki University\nHospital, Helsinki, Finland; Menno V.
