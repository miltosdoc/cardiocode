Practical instructions for history taking are given in sec-\ntions 3 and 4 of the Web Practical Instructions.\nWhen epileptic seizures or psychogenic attacks are likely, appro-\npriate steps should be taken. By using a detailed clinical history, phys-\nicians can differentiate syncope from other forms of TLOC in\napproximately 60% of cases.12 For non-syncopal TLOC, refer to sec-\ntions 7 and 8.\n4.1.1 Diagnosis of syncope\nThe starting point of the diagnostic evaluation of TLOC of suspected\nsyncopal nature is the initial syncope evaluation, which consists of:\n• Careful history taking concerning present and previous attacks, as\nwell as eyewitness accounts, in person or through a telephone\ninterview.\n• Physical\nexamination,\nincluding\nsupine\nand\nstanding\nBP\nmeasurements.\n• Electrocardiogram (ECG).\nBased on these findings, additional examinations may be per-\nformed when needed (see section 4.2):\n• Immediate ECG monitoring when there is a suspicion of arrhyth-\nmic syncope.\n• Echocardiogram when there is previous known heart disease,\ndata suggestive of structural heart disease, or syncope secondary\nto cardiovascular cause.\nFigure 4 Flow diagram for the initial evaluation and risk stratification of patients with syncope. BP = blood pressure; ECG = electrocardiogram;\nH&P exam = history and physical examination; TLOC = transient loss of consciousness.\nESC Guidelines\n1893\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/39/21/1883/4939241 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n......................\n• Carotid sinus massage (CSM) in patients aged >40 years.\n• Head-up tilt testing when there is suspicion of syncope due to\nOH or reflex syncope.\n• Blood tests when clinically indicated, e.g. haematocrit or haemo-\nglobin when haemorrhage is suspected, oxygen saturation and\nblood gas analysis when hypoxia is suspected, troponin when car-\ndiac ischaemia-related syncope is suspected, or D-dimer when\npulmonary embolism is suspected, etc.\nEven if there is no independent gold/reference standard to diag-\nnose syncope, there is strong consensus that the initial evalu-\nation may lead to certain or highly likely diagnosis when the\ndiagnostic criteria listed in the table of recommendations are\nmet.\nDiagnostic criteria with initial evaluation\nRecommendations\nClassa\nLevelb\nReﬂex syncope and OH\nVVS is highly probable if syncope is precipitated by pain, fear, or standing, and is associated with typical progressive prodrome\n(pallor, sweating, and/or nausea).8,13–17\nI\nC\nSituational reﬂex syncope is highly probable if syncope occurs during or immediately after speciﬁc triggers, listed in\nTable 3.8,13–17\nI\nC\nSyncope due to OH is conﬁrmed when syncope occurs while standing and there is concomitant signiﬁcant OH.18–24\nI\nC\nIn the absence of the above criteria, reﬂex syncope and OH should be considered likely when the features that suggest reﬂex\nsyncope or OH are present and the features that suggest cardiac syncope are absent (see Table 5).\nIIa\nC\nCardiac syncope\nArrhythmic syncope is highly probable when the ECG shows25–39:\n• Persistent sinus bradycardia <40 b.p.m. or sinus pauses >3 s in awake state and in absence of physical training;\n• Mobitz II second- and third-degree AV block;\n• Alternating left and right BBB;\n• VT or rapid paroxysmal SVT;\n• Non-sustained episodes of polymorphic VT and long or short QT interval; or\n• Pacemaker or ICD malfunction with cardiac pauses.\nI\nC\nCardiac ischaemia-related syncope is conﬁrmed when syncope presents with evidence of acute myocardial ischaemia with or\nwithout myocardial infarction.25–39\nI\nC\nSyncope due to structural cardiopulmonary disorders is highly probable when syncope presents in patients with prolapsing\natrial myxoma, left atrial ball thrombus, severe aortic stenosis, pulmonary embolus, or acute aortic dissection.\nI\nC\nAdditional advice and clinical perspectives\nThe initial syncope evaluation, as described in this document, can deﬁne the cause of syncope in most patients. Strict adherence to the above deﬁn-\nitions of VVS and situational reﬂex syncope, and of syncope due to OH, can be considered certain or highly likely irrespective of the presence of\nany other abnormal ﬁnding. In young subjects with unexplained syncope and no history of cardiac disease, no family history of sudden death, no su-\npine syncope or syncope during sleep or exercise, no unusual triggers, and a normal ECG, the chance of cardiac syncope is very low.

In other\ncases, the initial evaluation may suggest a diagnosis when the features\nlisted in Table 5 are present, or otherwise is unable to suggest any\ndiagnosis.\n4.1.2 Management of syncope in the emergency\ndepartment based on risk stratification\nThe management of TLOC of suspected syncopal nature in the ED\nshould answer the following three key questions:\n(1)\nIs there a serious underlying cause that can be identified?\n(2)\nWhat is the risk of a serious outcome?\n(3)\nShould the patient be admitted to hospital?\nFigure 5 shows a flow chart for the management and risk stratifica-\ntion of patients referred to the ED for TLOC suspected to be syn-\ncope (modified from Casagranda et al.40).\nQuestion 1: Is there a serious underlying cause that can be\nidentified in the ED?\nNormally the presenting complaint of syncope can be established.\nThe primary aim for an ED clinician is then to establish an underlying\ndiagnosis, especially those associated with the potential for rapid clin-\nical deterioration.41,42 It is the acute underlying disease that most fre-\nquently determines short-term adverse events rather than the\nsyncope itself.43 Subsequent management will focus on treating this\nunderlying cause (Figure 5). Many (40–45%) non-cardiovascular and\nsome cardiovascular life-threatening underlying conditions are obvi-\nous in the ED.44 Table 6 lists high-risk features that suggest the pres-\nence of a serious underlying cause and low-risk features that suggest\na benign underlying cause.\nQuestion 2: What is the risk of a serious outcome?\nHigh-risk features are shown in Table 6, and how to use this risk pro-\nfile to guide subsequent management and disposition is shown in\nFigure 6.\nRisk stratification is important, for two reasons:\n(1)\nTo recognize patients with a likely low-risk condition able to be dis-\ncharged with adequate patient education.\n(2)\nTo recognize patients with a likely high-risk cardiovascular condition\nrequiring urgent investigation. This may require admission.\nHigh-risk patients are more likely to have cardiac syncope.\nStructural heart disease25–27,31,35,36,45 and primary electrical disease46\nare major risk factors for sudden cardiac death (SCD) and overall\nmortality in patients with syncope. Low-risk patients are more likely\nto have reflex syncope and have an excellent prognosis.47 OH is\nassociated with a two-fold higher risk of death owing to the severity\nof comorbidities compared with the general population.48\nQuestion 3: Should the patient be admitted to hospital?\nApproximately 50% of patients who present to the ED with\nsyncope are admitted (although the rate varies between 12–86%)\n(see Supplementary Data Table 4).

In other\ncases, the initial evaluation may suggest a diagnosis when the features\nlisted in Table 5 are present, or otherwise is unable to suggest any\ndiagnosis.\n4.1.2 Management of syncope in the emergency\ndepartment based on risk stratification\nThe management of TLOC of suspected syncopal nature in the ED\nshould answer the following three key questions:\n(1)\nIs there a serious underlying cause that can be identified?\n(2)\nWhat is the risk of a serious outcome?\n(3)\nShould the patient be admitted to hospital?\nFigure 5 shows a flow chart for the management and risk stratifica-\ntion of patients referred to the ED for TLOC suspected to be syn-\ncope (modified from Casagranda et al.40).\nQuestion 1: Is there a serious underlying cause that can be\nidentified in the ED?\nNormally the presenting complaint of syncope can be established.\nThe primary aim for an ED clinician is then to establish an underlying\ndiagnosis, especially those associated with the potential for rapid clin-\nical deterioration.41,42 It is the acute underlying disease that most fre-\nquently determines short-term adverse events rather than the\nsyncope itself.43 Subsequent management will focus on treating this\nunderlying cause (Figure 5). Many (40–45%) non-cardiovascular and\nsome cardiovascular life-threatening underlying conditions are obvi-\nous in the ED.44 Table 6 lists high-risk features that suggest the pres-\nence of a serious underlying cause and low-risk features that suggest\na benign underlying cause.\nQuestion 2: What is the risk of a serious outcome?\nHigh-risk features are shown in Table 6, and how to use this risk pro-\nfile to guide subsequent management and disposition is shown in\nFigure 6.\nRisk stratification is important, for two reasons:\n(1)\nTo recognize patients with a likely low-risk condition able to be dis-\ncharged with adequate patient education.\n(2)\nTo recognize patients with a likely high-risk cardiovascular condition\nrequiring urgent investigation. This may require admission.\nHigh-risk patients are more likely to have cardiac syncope.\nStructural heart disease25–27,31,35,36,45 and primary electrical disease46\nare major risk factors for sudden cardiac death (SCD) and overall\nmortality in patients with syncope. Low-risk patients are more likely\nto have reflex syncope and have an excellent prognosis.47 OH is\nassociated with a two-fold higher risk of death owing to the severity\nof comorbidities compared with the general population.48\nQuestion 3: Should the patient be admitted to hospital?\nApproximately 50% of patients who present to the ED with\nsyncope are admitted (although the rate varies between 12–86%)\n(see Supplementary Data Table 4). The use of clinical decision rules and\nstandardized protocols has not changed this rate significantly.

Based on a consensus document,40 a single-centre\nexperience consisting of a short stay in the ED under observation of\n<_48 h coupled with fast-tracking to a syncope unit reduced the ad-\nmission rate to 29%.77 Among patients not admitted, 20% were dis-\ncharged after a short observation in the ED, 20% were fast-tracked to\nthe syncope unit, and 31% were discharged directly from the ED.77\nRisk stratification scores: There are several ED syncope clinical\ndecision rules that aim to stratify patients with syncope based on\nmedical history, examination, and ECG findings (see Supplementary\nif\nFigure 6 Emergency department risk stratification flow chart. Low- and high-risk features are listed in Table 6. ED = emergency department;\nSU = syncope unit.\nPatients with low-risk features. These patients do not need further diagnostic tests in the ED as they are likely to have reﬂex, situational,\nor orthostatic syncope. They may beneﬁt from reassurance, or counselling (see Web Practical Instructions section 9.1: ESC information\nsheet for patients affected by reﬂex syncope).\nPatients with high-risk features. These patients should be classiﬁed as HIGH RISK; they require an intensive diagnostic approach and may\nneed urgent treatment and admission.

In the absence of compensatory mechanisms, a fall in BP may\nlead to syncope.20,103,104 The diagnostic criteria for OH have been\ndefined by consensus.6\nCurrently, there are three methods for assessing the response to\nchange in posture from supine to erect20,103,104: active standing (see\nsection 4.2.2.1), head-up tilt (see section 4.2.2.2), and 24-h ambula-\ntory BP monitoring (ABPM) (see section 4.2.3.4).\n4.2.2.1 Active standing\nIndications: This test is used to diagnose different types of ortho-\nstatic intolerance (see Web Practical Instructions Web Table 1). A\nsphygmomanometer is adequate for routine clinical testing for classi-\ncal OH and delayed OH because of its ubiquity and simplicity.\nAutomatic arm-cuff devices, which are programmed to repeat and\nconfirm measurements when discrepant values are recorded, are at\na disadvantage due to the rapidly falling BP during OH. With a sphyg-\nmomanometer, more than four measurements per minute cannot\nbe obtained without venous obstruction in the arm. When more fre-\nquent readings are required, as for initial OH, continuous beat-to-\nbeat non-invasive BP measurement is needed.20,103,104\nDiagnostic criteria: Abnormal BP fall is defined as a progressive\nand sustained fall in systolic BP from baseline value >_20 mmHg or\ndiastolic BP >_10 mmHg, or a decrease in systolic BP to <90\nmmHg. This definition of OH differs from the 2011 consensus6 in\nadding the 90 mmHg threshold. This Task Force believes that an\nabsolute threshold of 90 mmHg of systolic BP is useful, especially\nin patients with a supine BP <110 mmHg. An isolated diastolic BP\ndrop is very rare and its clinical relevance for OH diagnosis is lim-\nited. Orthostatic heart rate (HR) increase is blunted or absent\n[usually not >10 beats per minute (b.p.m.)] in patients with neuro-\ngenic OH, but increases or even exaggerates with anaemia or\nhypovolaemia.

The most com-\nmonly used are the trinitroglycerin (TNG) test using 300–400 mg of\nsublingual TNG after a 20-min unmedicated phase,106,107 and the\nlow-dose intravenous isoproterenol test, which uses incremental\ndoses to increase average HR by about 20–25% over baseline (usu-\nally <_3 mg/min).108,109 In a recent systematic literature review,110 the\noverall positivity rate in patients with syncope was 66% for the TNG\nprotocol and 61% for the isoproterenol protocol; the respective pos-\nitivity rate in subjects without syncope (controls) ranged from\n11–14%; and the test differentiated patients with syncope from con-\ntrols with an odds ratio of 12. The methodology and classification of\nresponses are described in section 6 of the Web Practical Instructions.\nAdding video recording to a tilt table permits objective and repeated\nreview of clinical signs in relation to BP and HR, and helps to assess\nthe relative contribution of bradycardia and hypotension to syncope\n(see section 5.2.6.3 and the explanatory video in Web Practical\nInstructions section 6.3.15), and to distinguish between VVS and PPS\n(see section 4.2.5).\nThe clinical situation corresponding to tilt-induced syncope is that\nwhich is triggered by prolonged standing. The test should be\nconsidered: (i) to confirm a diagnosis of reflex syncope in patients in\nwhom this diagnosis was suspected but not confirmed by initial eval-\nuation105–109,111,\nand\n(ii)\nfor\nthe\nassessment\nof\nautonomic\nfailure, especially for the reproduction of delayed OH (which could not\nbe detected by active standing because of its delayed onset)23,24,112,113\nand postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS).114 Tilt testing\nmay be helpful in separating syncope from PPS.115–117\nTilt testing has limited value in assessing treatment efficacy.118\nHowever, tilt testing is widely accepted as a useful tool to demon-\nstrate susceptibility of the patient to reflex syncope, especially a\nhypotensive (vasodepressive) tendency, and thereby to initiate treat-\nment (e.g. physical manoeuvres, see section 5).119–121\nThe\nendpoint\nof\ntilt\ntesting\nis\nthe\nreproduction\nof\nsymptoms along with the characteristic circulatory pattern of\nthe indication mentioned above, namely the induction of reflex hypo-\ntension/bradycardia, OH, POTS, or PPS.

The most com-\nmonly used are the trinitroglycerin (TNG) test using 300–400 mg of\nsublingual TNG after a 20-min unmedicated phase,106,107 and the\nlow-dose intravenous isoproterenol test, which uses incremental\ndoses to increase average HR by about 20–25% over baseline (usu-\nally <_3 mg/min).108,109 In a recent systematic literature review,110 the\noverall positivity rate in patients with syncope was 66% for the TNG\nprotocol and 61% for the isoproterenol protocol; the respective pos-\nitivity rate in subjects without syncope (controls) ranged from\n11–14%; and the test differentiated patients with syncope from con-\ntrols with an odds ratio of 12. The methodology and classification of\nresponses are described in section 6 of the Web Practical Instructions.\nAdding video recording to a tilt table permits objective and repeated\nreview of clinical signs in relation to BP and HR, and helps to assess\nthe relative contribution of bradycardia and hypotension to syncope\n(see section 5.2.6.3 and the explanatory video in Web Practical\nInstructions section 6.3.15), and to distinguish between VVS and PPS\n(see section 4.2.5).\nThe clinical situation corresponding to tilt-induced syncope is that\nwhich is triggered by prolonged standing. The test should be\nconsidered: (i) to confirm a diagnosis of reflex syncope in patients in\nwhom this diagnosis was suspected but not confirmed by initial eval-\nuation105–109,111,\nand\n(ii)\nfor\nthe\nassessment\nof\nautonomic\nfailure, especially for the reproduction of delayed OH (which could not\nbe detected by active standing because of its delayed onset)23,24,112,113\nand postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS).114 Tilt testing\nmay be helpful in separating syncope from PPS.115–117\nTilt testing has limited value in assessing treatment efficacy.118\nHowever, tilt testing is widely accepted as a useful tool to demon-\nstrate susceptibility of the patient to reflex syncope, especially a\nhypotensive (vasodepressive) tendency, and thereby to initiate treat-\nment (e.g. physical manoeuvres, see section 5).119–121\nThe\nendpoint\nof\ntilt\ntesting\nis\nthe\nreproduction\nof\nsymptoms along with the characteristic circulatory pattern of\nthe indication mentioned above, namely the induction of reflex hypo-\ntension/bradycardia, OH, POTS, or PPS. The typical tilt test result\npatterns are shown in the Web Practical Instructions section 6.\nInterpretation of tilt testing results in patients with reflex syncope:\nSome studies122,123 compared the response to tilt testing with sponta-\nneous syncope recorded by an implantable loop recorder (ILR). While\na positive cardioinhibitory response to tilt testing predicts, with a high\nprobability, an asystolic spontaneous syncope, the presence of a\nTilt testing\nRecommendations\nClassa\nLevelb\nIndications\nTilt testing should be considered in patients with suspected reﬂex syncope, OH, POTS, or PPS.23,24,105–109,111–117\nIIa\nB\nTilt testing may be considered to educate patients to recognize symptoms and learn physical manoeuvres.119–121\nIIb\nB\nDiagnostic criteria\nReﬂex syncope, OH, POTS, or PPS should be considered likely if tilt testing reproduces symptoms along with the charac-\nteristic circulatory pattern of these conditions.23,24,105–109,111–117\nIIa\nB\nAdditional advice and clinical perspectives\n• A negative tilt table response does not exclude a diagnosis of reﬂex syncope.\n• While sensitivity and speciﬁcity are at acceptable levels when measured in patients with VVS and healthy controls, in usual clinical settings of syncope\nof uncertain origin tilt testing suggests the presence of a hypotensive susceptibility, which may exist not only in reﬂex syncope but also with other\ncauses of syncope including some forms of cardiac syncope. The concept of hypotensive susceptibility rather than diagnosis has important practical\nutility, because the presence or absence of hypotensive susceptibility plays a major role in guiding pacemaker therapy in patients affected by reﬂex\nsyncope and in the management of hypotensive therapies, which are frequently present in the elderly with syncope (see sections 5.1 and 5.2).\n• A positive cardioinhibitory response to tilt testing predicts, with high probability, asystolic spontaneous syncope; this ﬁnding is relevant for thera-\npeutic implications when cardiac pacing is considered (see section 5.2.6). Conversely, the presence of a positive vasodepressor, a mixed\nresponse, or even a negative response does not exclude the presence of asystole during spontaneous syncope.122,123\n• Tilt testing may be helpful in separating syncope with abnormal movements from epilepsy.137\n• Tilt testing may have value in distinguishing syncope from falls.23\n• Tilt testing may be helpful in separating syncope from PPS. In suspected PPS, the tilt test should preferably be performed together with EEG mon-\nitoring; a normal EEG helps to conﬁrm the diagnosis.116,117 In the absence of an EEG, a video recording will be helpful in conﬁrming the diagnosis.\n• Tilt testing should not be used to assess the efﬁcacy of a drug treatment.118\nEEG = electroencephalogram; OH = orthostatic hypotension; POTS = postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome; PPS = psychogenic pseudosyncope; VVS = vasovagal\nsyncope.\naClass of recommendation.\nbLevel of evidence.\nESC Guidelines\n1903\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/39/21/1883/4939241 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n.............................................................................................................................................................................\npositive vasodepressor, mixed response, or even a negative response,\ndoes not exclude the presence of asystole during spontaneous\nsyncope.122,123\nTilt testing has an acceptable sensitivity124 and specific-\nity106,124,125 when these are calculated in patients with true VVS\nor without a history of syncope. However, there is an inability to\napply the test to populations with syncope of uncertain cause\nwhere it is hoped that tilt testing might prove decisive. In these\nclinical settings, tilt testing fails to deliver (Figure 7). Indeed, tilt\ntesting was positive in 51–56% of patients with atypical clinical fea-\ntures suggesting a reflex mechanism,106,124–128 in 30–36% with\nunexplained syncope after full investigation,124,129 and in 45–47%\nwith true cardiac arrhythmic syncope.130,131 In other words, tilt\ntesting offers little diagnostic value in patients for whom it is most\nneeded. In these patients, a positive tilt test reveals a susceptibility\nto orthostatic stress.132 This hypotensive susceptibility plays a role in\ncausing syncope irrespective of the aetiology and mechanism of\nsyncope. For example, in arrhythmic syncope caused by paroxys-\nmal atrial tachyarrhythmias, the mechanism is a combination of\nonset of the arrhythmia itself and hypotensive susceptibility,\ncorroborated by positive tilt testing.130,131 Similarly, multifactorial\nmechanisms are likely in other types of cardiac syncope, e.g. aortic\nstenosis,133\nhypertrophic\ncardiomyopathy\n(HCM),134\nand\nsick sinus syndrome.135,136 The presence or absence of suscepti-\nbility explains the occurrence of syncope in some and not in\nothers affected by the same severity of arrhythmia or structural\ndefect. Tilt testing should now be considered a means of\nexposing a hypotensive tendency rather than being diagnostic of\nVVS. This concept has practical implications for therapy (see sec-\ntions 5.1 and 5.2).\n4.2.3 Basic autonomic function tests\nAutonomic function assessment helps to identify autonomic failure as\nthe underlying cause of syncope.\n4.2.3.1 Valsalva manoeuvre\nThe methodology of the Valsalva manoeuvre is described in section\n7.1.1 of the Web Practical Instructions and in Web Video 2. There is\nstrong evidence that the absence of a BP overshoot and an absence\nof a HR increase during the Valsalva is pathognomonic for neurogenic\nOH, occurring in primary and secondary autonomic failure, and the\ndegree of hypotension and/or lack of compensation during forced\nexpiration usually correlate with the degree of autonomic dysfunc-\ntion and related symptoms.138–143 In contrast, a pronounced BP fall\nbeyond what is normally expected during forced expiration, but a\nnormal chronotropic response during the manoeuvre, may occur in\npatients with suspected situational syncope, i.e. syncope occurring\nduring some forms of situational syncope, e.g. coughing, brass instru-\nment playing, singing, and weightlifting.144\n4.2.3.2 Deep breathing\nThe methodology of the deep-breathing test is described in section\n7.1.2 of the Web Practical Instructions. Under physiological conditions,\nHR rises during inspiration and falls during expiration. HR variability\nduring deep breathing (also called the expiratory/inspiratory index or\nE/I index) is >_15 b.p.m. in healthy individuals aged >50 years.145\nThere is strong consensus that blunted or abolished variation is sug-\ngestive of parasympathetic dysfunction.142,143,146,147\n4.2.3.3 Other autonomic function tests\nFurther tests to evaluate cardiovascular sympathetic function include\ncalculation of the 30:15 ratio, the cold pressure test, the sustained\nhand grip test, and mental arithmetic. There is weak evidence that\nthese tests may be useful.13,142,143,147\n4.2.3.4 Twenty-four-hour ambulatory and home blood pressure\nmonitoring\nTwenty-four-hour ABPM and home BP monitoring (HBPM) are\nincreasingly used to diagnose and monitor the treatment of hyperten-\nsion.148 There is strong evidence that OH is frequently associated with\na nocturnal ‘non-dipping’ or even ‘reverse-dipping’ BP pattern in\npatients with autonomic failure, with relevant therapeutic and prognos-\ntic implications140,148–151 (see Web Practical Instructions section 7.1.3). In\nthese patients, ABPM allows the assessment of nocturnal hypertension,\npostprandial hypotension, and exercise- and drug-induced hypoten-\nsion, as well as monitoring for side effects of antihypotensive regimens\nand pointing to additional disorders such as sleep apnoea.152 There is\nweak evidence that ABPM may also detect the degree of OH in daily\nlife better than single office BP measurements.153\nHBPM may be used to investigate the cause of orthostatic intoler-\nance, i.e. to clarify whether symptoms are due to OH or to other\ncauses, such as vertigo or motor imbalance in Parkinson’s disease or\nmultiple system atrophy. The evidence is weak. Finally, HBPM can be\nused to clarify that BP is not low during episodes of PPS.154\nFigure 7 Rates of tilt testing positivity in different clinical condi-\ntions. These studies used the Westminster protocol for passive\ntilt,125 the Italian protocol for trinitroglycerin tilt,106 and the clo-\nmipramine protocol,124 for a total of 1453 syncope patients and\n407 controls without syncope. Studies using other tilt protocols,\ne.g. isoproterenol challenge, were not included.

As a rule,\nECG monitoring is indicated only when there is a high pre-test proba-\nbility of identifying an arrhythmia associated with syncope, such as\nthose listed in Table 5.\n4.2.4.1 In-hospital monitoring\nIn-hospital monitoring (in bed or by telemetry) is warranted in\npatients with high-risk clinical features (defined in Table 6) suggesting\narrhythmic syncope, especially if the monitoring is applied immedi-\nately after syncope. Although the diagnostic yield of ECG monitoring\nvaries from 1.9–17.6%,158–160 it is justified by the need to avoid\nimmediate risk to the patient.\n4.2.4.2 Holter monitoring\nSince, in most patients, symptoms do not recur during monitoring, the\ntrue yield of Holter monitoring in syncope may be as low as 1–2% in\nan unselected population. In 15% of patients, symptoms were not asso-\nciated with arrhythmia.161 Thus, in these patients, a rhythm disturbance\ncould potentially be excluded as a cause of syncope. Holter monitoring\nin syncope is inexpensive in terms of set-up costs, but expensive in\nterms of cost per diagnosis.162 Holter monitoring in syncope may be of\nmore value if symptoms are frequent. Daily single or multiple episodes\nof LOC might increase the potential for symptom–ECG correlation.\n4.2.4.3 Prospective external event recorders\nEvent recorders are external devices that are applied by the patient\nwhen symptoms occur.

The results showed that initial implantation of an ILR in\nthe workup provided a 3.7 [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.7–5.0]\nincreased relative probability of a diagnosis compared with the con-\nventional strategy (see Supplementary Data Table 5). ILR was more\ncost-effective than a conventional strategy.172,173,177,178\nIn\npooled\ndata\nfrom\nnine\nstudies179\nperformed\nin\n506\npatients with unexplained syncope at the end of complete nega-\ntive work-up, a correlation between syncope and ECG was\nfound in 176 patients (35%); of these, 56% had asystole (or\nbradycardia in a few cases) at the time of the recorded event,\n11% had tachycardia, and 33% had no arrhythmia. Presyncope\nwas much less likely to be associated with an arrhythmia than\nsyncope. Similar findings were subsequently observed with ILR\nuse expanded in an early phase of evaluation in patients with\nrecurrent syncope of uncertain origin, in the absence of high-\nrisk criteria and structural heart disease,176,180–183 and in sus-\npected reflex syncope.184–186 In particular, an asystolic pause\nwas present during syncope in about 50% of these patients.\nThere are several areas of interest other than unexplained syn-\ncope in which ILRs have been investigated:\n• Patients with bundle branch block (BBB) in whom paroxysmal\natrioventricular (AV) block is likely despite negative complete\nEPS: an arrhythmia was observed in 41% of these patients (being\nparoxysmal AV block in 70%) under ILR observation, based on\npooled data from three studies174,187,188 (see Supplementary Data\nTable 6).\n• Patients in whom epilepsy was suspected but the treatment has\nproven ineffective: in pooled data, an attack could have\nbeen documented by ILR in 62% of patients, with an arrhythmic\ncause being responsible in 26%137,189–191 (see Supplementary Data\nTable 7).\n• Patients with unexplained falls: in pooled data, an attack could\nhave been documented by ILR in 70% of patients, with an\narrhythmic\ncause\nbeing\nresponsible\nin\n14%191–194\n(see\nSupplementary Data Table 8).\n• Patients with HCM, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomy-\nopathy (ARVC), or primary electrical diseases (see section 5.4).\n4.2.4.8 Diagnostic criteria\nThe gold standard for the diagnosis of arrhythmic syncope is when\nthere is a correlation between the symptoms and an ECG record-\ning.195,196 The presence of asymptomatic significant arrhythmias—\ndefined as prolonged asystole (>_3 s), rapid supraventricular\ntachycardias (SVTs) (i.e. >160 b.p.m. for >32 beats), or ventricular\ntachycardias (VTs)—has been considered by several authors to be a\ndiagnostic finding.185,188,197–199 On the other hand, although the\nabsence of documentation of an arrhythmia during a syncopal epi-\nsode cannot be considered to be a specific diagnosis, it allows the\nexclusion of an arrhythmia as the mechanism of the syncope. Most\nevidence in support of the above diagnostic criteria is indirectly based\non the benefit of specific therapies guided by ECG monitoring in pre-\nventing syncopal recurrences.172,184–186,188,200\nEven if the quality of evidence is moderate, there is strong con-\nsensus based on evidence from several controlled trials that a\ncorrelation between symptoms and a documented arrhythmia,\nor the presence of some asymptomatic significant arrhythmias\n(defined above), is diagnostic of the cause of syncope and spe-\ncific treatment must be prescribed.\nThe principal limitation of any ECG monitoring device is the\ninability to record BP together with ECG. In reflex syncope, the\ndocumentation of bradycardia/asystole during a syncopal episode\ndoes not rule out the possibility that a hidden hypotensive reflex\nis the principal cause for syncope, and that bradycardia/asystole is\na secondary late event. This issue has important implications for\ntherapy (see section 5). A classification of ECG recordings with\ntheir probable related pathophysiology is available in Web Table 6\nand Web Practical Instructions section 8.\n1906\nESC Guidelines\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/39/21/1883/4939241 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n..................\n4.2.5 Video recording in suspected syncope\n4.2.5.1 In-hospital video recording\nFor PNES, a video-electroencephalogram (EEG) forms the highest\nlevel of diagnostic probability.204 For syncope and PPS, video can play\na similar, probably underused, role (see section 7). Adding video\nrecording to a tilt table test adds the ability to review clinical signs in\nrelation to BP and HR objectively and repeatedly, thus helping to dis-\ntinguish VVS from PPS. This approach has revealed new pathophysio-\nlogical insights in syncope.9 Attaching the camera to the tilt table\nallows detailed study of the face and head, which is useful when\nassessing the start and end of LOC.9,205 Video recording of tilt-\ninduced PPS116 ensures that apparent TLOC occurs while BP and HR\nElectrocardiographic monitoring\nRecommendations\nClassa\nLevelb\nIndications\nImmediate in-hospital monitoring (in bed or by telemetry) is indicated in high-risk patients (deﬁned in Table 6).\nI\nC\nHolter monitoring should be considered in patients who have frequent syncope or presyncope (>_1 episode per week).161\nIIa\nB\nExternal loop recorders should be considered, early after the index event, in patients who have an inter-symptom interval <_4\nweeks.162,166,168,201\nIIa\nB\nILR is indicated in an early phase of evaluation in patients with recurrent syncope of uncertain origin, absence of high-risk\ncriteria (listed in Table 6), and a high likelihood of recurrence within the battery life of the device.175,176,181–184,202,\nSupplementary Data Table 5\nI\nA\nILR is indicated in patients with high-risk criteria (listed in Table 6) in whom a comprehensive evaluation did not demon-\nstrate a cause of syncope or lead to a speciﬁc treatment, and who do not have conventional indications for primary preven-\ntion ICD or pacemaker indication.174,180,187,188,195, Supplementary Data Tables 5 and 6\nI\nA\nILR should be considered in patients with suspected or certain reﬂex syncope presenting with frequent or severe syncopal\nepisodes.184–186\nIIa\nB\nILR may be considered in patients in whom epilepsy was suspected but the treatment has proven ineffective.137,189–191,\nSupplementary Data Table 7\nIIb\nB\nILR may be considered in patients with unexplained falls.191–194, Supplementary Data Table 8\nIIb\nB\nDiagnostic criteria\nArrhythmic syncope is conﬁrmed when a correlation between syncope and an arrhythmia (bradyarrhythmia or tachyar-\nrhythmia) is detected.172,184–186,188,200\nI\nB\nIn the absence of syncope, arrhythmic syncope should be considered likely when periods of Mobitz II second- or third-\ndegree AV block or a ventricular pause >3 s (with the possible exception of young trained persons, during sleep or rate-\ncontrolled atrial ﬁbrillation), or rapid prolonged paroxysmal SVT or VT are detected.185,188,197–199\nIIa\nC\nAdditional advice and clinical perspectives\n• Be aware that the pre-test selection of the patients inﬂuences the subsequent ﬁndings.

The method has been proven to show the com-\nbined presence of VVS and PPS.117\n4.2.5.2 Home video recording\nHome video records (by means of smartphone technology) are very\nuseful in all forms of TLOC to allow signs of an attack to be studied.\nPatients and their relatives should be urged to record attacks, if possi-\nble, in cases of diagnostic uncertainty. In epilepsy, advances are made\ntowards\nprolonged\nvideo\nand\nEEG\nrecording\nin\npatients’\nhomes.206,207 For syncope or PPS, experience suggests that the chan-\nces of obtaining a video record are higher for PPS than for syncope,\nwhich is probably the effect of a high frequency and long duration of\nattacks in PPS. It is rare for the beginning of events to be recorded.206\nHome video records allow complex events such as syncope-induced\nepileptic seizures to be diagnosed.208\n4.2.6\nElectrophysiological study\nIndications: In an overview of eight studies, including 625 patients\nwith syncope undergoing EPS,209 positive results occurred predomi-\nnantly in patients with structural heart disease. In recent years, the\ndevelopment of powerful non-invasive methods, i.e. prolonged ECG\nmonitoring, showing a higher diagnostic value, has decreased the\nimportance of EPS as a diagnostic test. In clinical practice, registry data\nshow that approximately 3% of patients with unexplained syncope\nevaluated by cardiologists undergo EPS and even fewer if they are\nevaluated by other specialists.71 Nevertheless, EPS remains useful for\ndiagnosis in the following specific clinical situations: asymptomatic\nsinus bradycardia (suspected sinus arrest causing syncope), bifascicu-\nlar\nBBB\n(impending\nhigh-degree\nAV\nblock),\nand\nsuspected\ntachycardia.\nDiagnostic criteria: 4.2.6.1 Asymptomatic sinus bradycardia: sus-\npected sinus arrest causing syncope\nThe pre-test probability of bradycardia-related syncope is relatively\nhigh when there is asymptomatic sinus bradycardia (<50 b.p.m.) or\nsinoatrial block, usually documented by 12-lead ECG or ECG moni-\ntoring. The prognostic value of a prolonged sinus node recovery time\n(SNRT) is not well defined. An abnormal response is defined as >_1.6\nor 2 s for SNRT, or >_525 ms for corrected SNRT.210 One observatio-\nnal study showed a relationship between the presence of prolonged\nSNRT at EPS and the effect of pacing on symptoms.211 Another small\nprospective study showed that a corrected SNRT >_800 ms had an\neight-fold higher risk of syncope than a SNRT below this value.212\n4.2.6.2 Syncope in bifascicular bundle branch block (impending high-\ndegree atrioventricular block)\nPatients with bifascicular block and syncope are at higher risk of devel-\noping high-degree AV block.213 A prolonged HV interval >_70 ms, or\ninduction of second- or third-degree AV block by pacing or by phar-\nmacological stress (ajmaline, procainamide, or disopyramide), identi-\nfies a group at higher risk of developing AV block. By combining the\nabove-mentioned parts of the electrophysiological protocol, a positive\nEPS yielded a positive predictive value as high as >_80% for the identifi-\ncation of patients who will develop AV block in old studies.214–216\nThis finding has been indirectly confirmed by recent studies that\nshowed a significant reduction in syncopal recurrences in patients\nwith prolonged HV implanted with a pacemaker compared with a\ncontrol group of untreated patients with a negative EPS188, or with a\ncontrol group who received an empiric pacemaker.217 These results\njustify an upgrade of the recommendation for EPS-guided therapy (i.e.\ncardiac pacing) in patients with a positive EPS from class IIa to class I.\nEven if the quality of evidence is moderate, there is strong con-\nsensus that a positive EPS indicates that the likely mechanism\nof syncope is paroxysmal AV block.\nConversely, approximately one-third of patients with a negative EPS in\nwhom an ILR was implanted developed intermittent or permanent AV\nblock on follow-up.187 Thus, EPS has a low negative predictive value.\nMortality is high in patients with syncope and BBB. However, neither\nsyncope nor prolonged H-V interval were associated with a higher risk\nof death, and pacemaker therapy did not decrease this risk.213\n4.2.6.3 Suspected tachycardia\nIn patients with syncope preceded by a sudden onset of brief palpita-\ntions suggesting SVT or VT, an EPS may be indicated to assess the\nexact mechanism, especially when a curative catheter ablation proce-\ndure is considered to be beneficial.\nIn patients with a previous myocardial infarction and preserved left\nventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), induction of sustained mono-\nmorphic VT is strongly predictive of the cause of syncope,218\nwhereas the induction of ventricular fibrillation (VF) is considered a\nnon-specific finding.37 The absence of induction of ventricular\narrhythmias identifies a group at lower risk of arrhythmic syncope.219\nThe role of EPS and the use of pharmacological challenge by\nclass I antiarrhythmic drugs in patients with syncope and sus-\npected Brugada syndrome is controversial. In a recent meta-analy-\nsis,220 the risk of arrhythmic events was slightly increased in\npatients with a history of unexplained syncope or a spontaneous\ntype 1 pattern, and who had induction of VT or VF with one or\ntwo extra stimuli. However, the absence of induction in such indi-\nviduals does not necessarily preclude arrhythmia risk, particularly\nin patients with high-risk features.\nVideo recording in suspected syncope\nRecommendations\nClassa\nLevelb\nHome video recordings of spontaneous\nevents should be considered. Physicians\nshould encourage patients and their rel-\natives to obtain home video recordings\nof spontaneous events.206,208\nIIa\nC\nAdding video recording to tilt testing\nmay be considered in order to increase\nthe reliability of clinical observation of\ninduced events.9,116,117,205\nIIb\nC\naClass of recommendation.\nbLevel of evidence.\n1908\nESC Guidelines\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/39/21/1883/4939241 by guest on 14 January 2026",

Owing to the unpredictability of syncope recurrence, be\nprepared to wait up to 4 years or more before obtaining such a correlation.203\n• In the absence of a documented arrhythmia, presyncope cannot be considered a surrogate for syncope, whereas the documentation of a signifi-\ncant arrhythmia at the time of presyncope can be considered a diagnostic finding.199\n• The absence of arrhythmia during syncope excludes arrhythmic syncope. |  |  | \n |  |  |  |  | \n |  |  |  |  | \n | AV = atrioventricular; ICD = implantable cardioverter defibrillator; ILR = implantable loop recorder; SVT = supraventricular tachycardia; VT = ventricular tachycardia.\naClass of recommendation. |  |  |  | \n | bLevel of evidence. |  |  |  | \n |  |  |  |  | ",

Bradycardia is a frequent mechanism of syncope.\nCardiac pacing is the most powerful therapy for bradycardia but\nits efficacy is less if hypotension coexists (see Table 9 and\nSupplementary Data Table 9). The treatment of syncope due to a\nhypotensive reflex or to OH is more challenging because specific\ntherapies are less effective.\n• Often, therapy to prevent recurrence differs from that for the\nunderlying disease. The management of patients at high risk of\nSCD requires careful assessment of the individual patient’s risk\n(see section 5.5).\n• Syncopal recurrences often decrease spontaneously after medical\nassessment, even in the absence of a specific therapy; in general,\nsyncope recurs in <50% of patients within 1–2 years (see\nSupplementary Data Table 10). The decrease seems to be more\nevident when there is a lack of a clear anatomical substrate for\nsyncope, such as in the case of reflex syncope and unexplained\nsyncope. The reason for this decrease is not known. Several\npotential clinical, statistical, and psychological explanations have\nbeen provided and all probably play a role (see Supplementary\nData Table 10). Whatever the reason, the possibility of spontane-\nous improvement has major practical importance for treatment\nthat can be postponed in low-risk conditions.

The management of patients at high risk of\nSCD requires careful assessment of the individual patient’s risk\n(see section 5.5).\n• Syncopal recurrences often decrease spontaneously after medical\nassessment, even in the absence of a specific therapy; in general,\nsyncope recurs in <50% of patients within 1–2 years (see\nSupplementary Data Table 10). The decrease seems to be more\nevident when there is a lack of a clear anatomical substrate for\nsyncope, such as in the case of reflex syncope and unexplained\nsyncope. The reason for this decrease is not known. Several\npotential clinical, statistical, and psychological explanations have\nbeen provided and all probably play a role (see Supplementary\nData Table 10). Whatever the reason, the possibility of spontane-\nous improvement has major practical importance for treatment\nthat can be postponed in low-risk conditions. The consequence\nof the spontaneous decrease is that any therapy for syncope pre-\nvention appears to be more effective than it actually is, which\nmakes the results of observational data on therapy questionable\nin the absence of a control group.\n5.2 Treatment of reflex syncope\nDespite its benign course, recurrent and unpredictable reflex syn-\ncope may be disabling.

Only 14% of\nthe highly selected population with reflex syncope who are referred to\nspecialized syncope units may need such additional treatment.186 In gen-\neral, no therapy is appropriate for every form of reflex syncope. The\nmost important discriminant for the choice of therapy is age. A decision\npathway for the selection of a specific therapy according to age, severity\nof syncope, and clinical forms is summarized in Figure 9.\n5.2.1 Education and lifestyle modifications\nEducation and lifestyle modifications have not been evaluated in\nrandomized studies, but there is a consensus for implementing them\nas first-line therapy in all cases. These comprise reassurance about\nthe benign nature of the disease, education regarding awareness and the\npossible avoidance of triggers and situations (e.g. dehydration and/or\nhot crowded environments), and the early recognition of prodromal\nsymptoms in order to sit or lie down and activate counter-pressure\nmanoeuvres without delay. If possible, triggers should be addressed\ndirectly, such as cough suppression in cough syncope, micturition in the\nsitting position, etc. Increased intake of oral fluids is also advised. Salt\nsupplementation at a dose of 120 mmol/day of sodium chloride has\nbeen proposed.259 In general, >50% of patients with recurrent syncopal\nepisodes in the 1 or 2 years before evaluation do not have syncopal\nrecurrences in the following 1 or 2 years and, in those with recurrences,\nTable 9\nExpected syncope recurrence rates with a permanent pacemaker in different clinical settings (for more\ndetails see Supplementary Data Table 9).\nClinical setting\nExpected 2-year syncope recurrence rate\nwith cardiac pacing\nSyncope due to established bradycardia and absence of hypotensive mechanism\nHigh efﬁcacy (<_5% recurrence rate)\nSyncope due to established bradycardia and associated hypotensive mechanism\nModerate efﬁcacy (5–25% recurrence rate)\nSyncope due to suspected bradycardia and associated hypotensive mechanism\nLow efﬁcacy (>25% recurrence rate)\nFigure 8 General framework of treatment is based on risk stratification and the identification of specific mechanisms when possible.

The effect of education and reassurance is\nprobably the most likely reason for the decrease in syncope\n(see Supplementary Data Table 10). An example of a patient instruction\nsheet can be found in the Web Practical Instructions section 9.1: European\nSociety of Cardiology information sheet for patients affected by reflex\nsyncope.\nDespite the lack of controlled studies, there is strong consensus\nthat education and lifestyle modifications have a high impact\nin reducing recurrence of syncope.\n5.2.2 Discontinuation/reduction of hypotensive therapy\nCareful avoidance of agents that lower BP, i.e. any antihyperten-\nsive agents, nitrates, diuretics, neuroleptic antidepressants, or\nFigure 9 Schematic practical decision pathway for the first-line management of reflex syncope (based on patient’s history and tests) according to\nage, severity of syncope, and clinical forms. Younger patients are those aged <40 years while older patients are >60 years, with an overlap between 40\nand 60 years. Severity of reflex syncope is defined in the text. The duration of prodrome is largely subjective and imprecise. A value of <_5 s distinguishes\narrhythmic from reflex syncope49; in patients without structural heart disease, a duration >10 s can distinguish reflex syncope from cardiac syncope.38\nIn practice, the prodrome is ‘absent or very short’ if it does not allow patients enough time to act, such as to sit or lie down. The heading’ low BP phe-\nnotype’ identifies patients with chronic low BP values (in general, systolic around 110 mmHg, who have a clear history of orthostatic intolerance and\northostatic VVS). The group ‘dominant cardioinhibition‘ identifies patients in whom clinical features and results of tests suggest that sudden cardioinhibi-\ntion is mainly responsible for syncope. One such clue is lack of prodrome, so patients without prodromes may, after analysis, fall into this category.\nRemark:\n\u0003\nOverlap between subgroups is expected.\n\u0003\nIn selected cases, pacing may be used in patients aged <40 years.

In a small randomized trial260 performed in 58 patients\n(mean age 74 ± 11 years) affected by vasodepressor reflex syn-\ncope diagnosed by tilt testing or CSM, who were taking on average\n2.5 hypotensive drugs, discontinuation or reduction of the vasoac-\ntive therapy caused a reduction of the rate of the primary com-\nbined endpoint of syncope, presyncope, and adverse events from\n50 to 19% (hazard ratio 0.37) compared with a control group who\ncontinued hypotensive therapy during a follow-up of 9 months. In\nthe Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial,261 patients at high\ncardiovascular risk who were already using antihypertensive drugs\ntargeting a systolic BP of 120 mmHg had an approximately two-\nfold risk of syncope vs. the control group targeting a systolic BP of\n140 mmHg. In a short-term randomized trial262 conducted in 32\npatients affected by CSS, withdrawal of vasodilator therapy\nreduced the magnitude of the vasodepressor reflex induced by\nCSM.\nThere is moderate evidence that discontinuation/reduction of\nhypotensive therapy targeting a systolic BP of 140 mmHg\nshould be effective in reducing syncopal recurrences in patients\nwith hypotensive susceptibility. Further research is likely to\nhave an important impact on our confidence in the estimate.\n5.2.3 Physical counter-pressure manoeuvres\nIsometric muscle contractions increase cardiac output and arterial BP\nduring the phase of impending reflex syncope. Three clinical stud-\nies119,120,263 and one prospective multicentre randomized trial121\nassessed the effectiveness of physical counter-pressure manoeuvres\n(PCM) of the legs or arms and showed that they allowed the patient\nto avoid or delay losing consciousness in most cases. In the Physical\nCounterpressure Manoeuvres Trial (PC-Trial),121 223 patients aged\n38 ± 15 years with recurrent reflex syncope and recognizable pro-\ndromal symptoms were randomized to receive standardized conven-\ntional therapy alone or conventional therapy plus training in PCM.\nActuarial recurrence-free survival was better in the PCM group\n(log-rank P=0.018), resulting in a relative risk reduction of 39% (95%\nCI 11–53). No adverse events were reported. A limitation of this\ntreatment is that it cannot be used in patients with short or absent\nprodrome and that PCM are less effective in patients older than 60\nyears.264 An instruction sheet on how to perform PCM can be found\nin the Web Practical Instructions section 9.2.\nThere is moderate evidence that PCM is effective in reducing\nsyncopal recurrences in patients <60 years old with long-\nlasting recognizable prodromal symptoms.\n5.2.4 Tilt training\nIn highly motivated young patients with recurrent vasovagal symp-\ntoms triggered by orthostatic stress, the prescription of progressively\nprolonged periods of enforced upright posture (so-called tilt training)\nhas been proposed to reduce syncope recurrence.265 While some\nstudies suggested modest benefit with outpatient tilt training,266,267\nmost\ncontrolled\ntrials\nreported\nno\nsignificant\neffect.268–272\nMoreover, this treatment is hampered by the low compliance of\npatients in continuing the training programme for a long period.\nThere is sufficient evidence from multiple trials that tilt train-\ning has little efficacy in reducing recurrence of syncope in\nyoung patients with long-lasting recognizable prodromal symp-\ntoms. Further research is unlikely to have an important impact\non our confidence in the estimate.\n5.2.5 Pharmacological therapy\nPharmacological therapy may be considered in patients who have\nrecurrent syncope despite education and lifestyle modifications\nincluding training in PCM. Many drugs have been tested in the treat-\nment of reflex syncope, for the most part with disappointing results.\nWhile results have been satisfactory in uncontrolled trials or short-\nterm controlled trials, several long-term placebo-controlled prospec-\ntive trials have not shown a benefit of the active drug over placebo,\nwith some exceptions.\n5.2.5.1 Fludrocortisone\nFludrocortisone, by increasing renal sodium reabsorption and\nexpanding plasma volume, may counteract the physiological cascade\nleading to the orthostatic vasovagal reflex.273 The mechanism of\naction can be compared with that of saline infusion, which has also\nproved effective in acute tilt test studies.274 The Prevention of\nSyncope Trial (POST) 2275 enrolled 210 young (median age 30 years)\npatients with low–normal values of arterial BP and without comor-\nbidities, and randomized them to receive fludrocortisone (titrated at\na dosage of 0.05–0.2 mg once per day) or placebo. The primary end-\npoint showed only a marginal non-significant reduction in syncope in\nthe fludrocortisone group compared with the placebo group (hazard\nratio 0.69, 95% CI 0.46–1.03; P=0.069), which became more signifi-\ncant when the analysis was restricted to patients who achieved 0.2\nmg/day dose stabilization at 2 weeks. The clinical benefit of fludrocor-\ntisone therapy was modest: at 12 months, 44% of patients in the flu-\ndrocortisone arm continued to suffer syncope, a rate only slightly\nlower than the 60.5% rate observed in the placebo arm. In the mean-\ntime, a similar number of patients discontinued fludrocortisone ther-\napy owing to side effects, thus equating the benefit/risk ratio.\nFludrocortisone should not be used in patients with hypertension or\nheart failure. Fludrocortisone was ineffective in a small randomized\ndouble-blind trial in children.276\nThere is moderate evidence that fludrocortisone may be effec-\ntive in reducing syncopal recurrences in young patients with\nlownormal values of arterial BP and without comorbidities.\nFurther research is likely to have an important impact on our\nconfidence in the estimate of effect.\n5.2.5.2 Alpha-agonists\nAs failure to achieve proper vasoconstriction of the peripheral ves-\nsels is common in reflex syncope, alpha-agonist vasoconstrictors (eti-\nlefrine and midodrine) have been used. Etilefrine has been studied in\na large randomized placebo-controlled double-blind trial.277 During\nfollow-up, patients treated twice daily with etilefrine 25 mg or pla-\ncebo showed no difference in the frequency of syncope or the time\nto recurrence. Midodrine [usually 2.5–10 mg, three times daily (t.i.d)]\nhas proved effective in small studies but none satisfied the criteria of\na pivotal clinical trial. A recent systematic review of these trials278\n1914\nESC Guidelines\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/39/21/1883/4939241 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n.............................................................................................................................................................................\nshowed that the confidence in estimates was moderate because of\nimprecision and publication bias. The most frequent side effects that\nled to discontinuation of midodrine were supine hypertension, pilo-\nmotor reactions, and urinary problems (urinary retention, hesitancy,\nor urgency). The major limitation of midodrine is frequent dosing,\nwhich limits long-term compliance. Overall, these data suggest that\nchronic pharmacological treatment with alpha-agonists alone may be\nof little use in reflex syncope and that long-term treatment cannot be\nadvised for occasional symptoms.\nThere are contrasting results from multiple trials that alpha-\nagonists may be effective in reducing syncopal recurrences in\npatients with the orthostatic form of VVS. Further research is\nlikely to have an important impact on our confidence in the\nestimate.\n5.2.5.3 Beta-blockers\nBeta-blockers have been presumed to lessen the degree of ventricu-\nlar mechanoreceptor activation owing to their negative inotropic\neffect in reflex syncope. This theory has not been supported by the\noutcome of clinical trials. Beta-blockers failed to be effective in VVS\nin two randomized double-blind controlled trials.279,280 A rationale\nfor the use of beta-blockers in other forms of neutrally-mediated syn-\ncope is lacking. It should be emphasized that beta-blockers may\nenhance bradycardia in CSS.\nThere is sufficient evidence from multiple trials that beta-\nblockers are not appropriate in reducing syncopal recurrences.\nDesirable and undesirable effects are closely balanced.\n5.2.5.4 Other drugs\nParoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, was effective in\none placebo-controlled trial, which included highly symptomatic\npatients from one institution.281 This finding has not been confirmed\nin other studies and has no experimental support. Conversely,\nhuman studies with different subtypes of serotonin-receptor antago-\nnists demonstrated a decreased tolerance to tilt.1,282 In a small\nrandomized trial, benzodiazepine was as effective as metoprolol.283\nA somatostatin analogue (octreotide)284 was used in a few patients\naffected by orthostatic intolerance and its effect cannot be properly\nevaluated.\n5.2.5.5 Emerging new therapies in specific subgroups\nLow-adenosine phenotype. In a series of case reports, theophylline\nappeared effective in patients with recurrent sudden onset (pre)syn-\ncope who presented with the common biological characteristic of\nlow circulating adenosine levels.285,286 Theophylline is a non-selective\nadenosine receptor antagonist that is potentially effective when\nadenosine is suspected to be involved in the mechanism of syncope.\nAn intra-patient comparison between a period with and a period\nwithout theophylline therapy, with the support of prolonged ECG\nmonitoring, showed that symptoms disappeared and the number of\nprolonged asystolic pauses was impressively reduced from a median\nof 1.11 per month during 13 months of no treatment to 0 per month\nduring 20 months of theophylline treatment.\nLow-norepinephrine phenotype. A mismatch between sympathetic\nnerve activity and norepinephrine spillover is present in patients with\northostatic VVS.287 Norepinephrine transport inhibitors (reboxetine\nand sibutramine) lead to a selective increase in sympathetic tone dur-\ning stress by inhibiting the reuptake of norepinephrine in sympathetic\nneuronal synapses. In double-blind, randomized, crossover fashion,\nreboxetine and sibutramine block or attenuate the vasovagal reflex\nduring tilt testing.288 In an open-label prospective clinical study in\nseven very symptomatic patients who had not responded to any pre-\nvious treatment, sibutramine achieved 94% suppression of syncopal\nepisodes at 6 months.289\nGanglionic plexus ablation. Radiofrequency ablation of vagal ganglia\nlocated close to the sinus node and AV node was reported to abolish\nthe vagal efferent output during VVS in some observational studies\nand case reports.290,291 However, owing to a weak rationale, small\npopulations, weak documentation of follow-up results, procedural\nrisks, and lack of control groups, the current evidence is insufficient\nto confirm the efficacy of vagal ganglia ablation.\n5.2.6 Cardiac pacing\nPermanent pacemaker therapy may be effective if asystole is a domi-\nnant feature of reflex syncope. Establishing a relationship between\nsymptoms and bradycardia should be the goal of the clinical evalua-\ntion of patients with syncope and a normal baseline ECG. The efficacy\nof pacing depends on the clinical setting. A comparative table of\nresults in different settings is reported in the Supplementary Data\nTable 9. Figure 10 summarizes the recommended indication for\npacing.\n5.2.6.1 Evidence from trials in suspected or certain reflex syncope and\nelectrocardiogram-documented asystole\nIn two observational studies, cardiac pacing reduced syncope burden\nin patients with documented asystolic syncope by 92184 and 83%,200\nbut did not prevent all syncopal events. In the randomized\ndouble-blind Third International Study on Syncope of Uncertain\nEtiology (ISSUE)-3 trial,185 77 patients who had documentation, by\nmeans of ILR, of syncope with >_3-s asystole or >_6-s asystole without\nsyncope were randomly assigned to receive either dual-chamber pac-\ning with rate drop response or sensing only. During follow-up, the 2-\nyear estimated rate of syncope recurrence was 57% with pacemaker\noff and 25% with pacemaker on (log-rank P¼0.039). The risk of\nrecurrence was reduced by 57%. In the ILR subgroup of the multi-\ncentre Syncope Unit Project (SUP) 2 study,292 the estimated rates of\nsyncope recurrence with pacing were 11% at 1 year, 24% at 2 years,\nand 24% at 3 years, and were significantly lower than the correspond-\ning rates observed in untreated control patients. The above evidence\nsupports a class IIa recommendation\nThere is sufficient evidence that dual-chamber cardiac pacing\nshould be considered to reduce recurrence of syncope when\nthe correlation between symptoms and ECG is established in\npatients \u000440 years of age with the clinical features of those in\nthe ISSUE studies.\n5.2.6.2 Evidence from trials in patients with carotid sinus syndrome\nThe evidence supporting the benefit of cardiac pacing in patients\naffected by cardioinhibitory CSS is limited to a few small controlled\ntrials and retrospective observational studies. In a review293 including\nESC Guidelines\n1915\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/39/21/1883/4939241 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n..............................................................................................\n12 studies for a total of 601 paced and 305 unpaced patients, the syn-\ncopal recurrence rate during follow-up ranged from 0–20% with pac-\ning, whereas the recurrence of syncope was always higher in\nuntreated patients, who showed a rate between 20–60%. In a meta-\nanalysis of the three studies293 with a control group of untreated\npatients, syncope recurred in 9% of 85 paced patients and in 38% of\n91 controls (relative risk 0.24, 95% CI 0.12–0.48). In a single-centre\nregistry of 169 consecutive patients treated with pacemakers, the\nactuarial estimate of syncopal recurrence was 7% at 1 year, 16% at\n3 years, and 20% at 5 years.90 In the CSS subgroup of the multicentre\nSUP 2 study,292 the estimated syncope recurrence rates with pacing\nwere 9% at 1 year, 18% at 2 years, and 20% at 3 years, and were signif-\nicantly lower than the corresponding rates observed in untreated\ncontrols, which were 21%, 33%, and 43%, respectively. Given the\nsimilar outcome of patients with reflex spontaneous asystolic pauses\nand those with CSS, this Task Force voted to downgrade the recom-\nmendation for pacing in patients with CSS from class I (as in the 2013\nESC Pacing Guidelines294) to class IIa.\nDespite the lack of large RCTs, there is sufficient evidence that\ndual-chamber cardiac pacing should be considered to reduce\nsyncopal recurrences in patients affected by dominant cardi-\noinhibitory CSS.\nTwo variables are well known to hamper the efficacy of pacing ther-\napy in CSS: the mixed forms93,98 (see also Web Practical Instructions\nsection 5) and the association with positivity of tilt testing. Patients\nwho have positive tilt tests have a three-fold greater probability of\nsyncope recurrence after dual chamber pacing than those with nega-\ntive tilt tests293,295; thus, when tilt testing is positive, caution must be\nrecommended over pacemaker implantation.\n5.2.6.3 Evidence from trials in patients with tilt-induced vasovagal\nsyncope\nEffectiveness of pacing in patients with tilt-induced VVS has been\nstudied in five multicentre RCTs.296–300 When combining the results\nof these trials, 318 patients were evaluated; syncope recurred in 21%\nof the paced patients and in 44% of unpaced patients (P < 0.001). A\nmeta-analysis of all studies suggested a non-significant 17% reduction\nin syncope from the double-blind studies, and an 84% reduction in\nthe studies where the control group did not receive a pacemaker.301\nIn general, pacing was ineffective in trials that enrolled patients with-\nout an asystolic tilt response.299,300 All of these studies have limita-\ntions, and a direct comparison is somewhat difficult because of\nimportant differences in study design, largely focused on patient\nselection. Overall, in typical vasovagal populations, pacing seems to\nhave marginal efficacy.\nThe rationale for the efficacy of cardiac pacing is that the cardioin-\nhibitory reflex is dominant in some patients, as there is no role for\npacing in the preventing vasodilatation and hypotension. In a substudy\nof the ISSUE-3 trial,302 an asystolic response during tilt testing pre-\ndicted a similar asystolic form during spontaneous ILR-documented\nsyncope, with a positive predictive value of 86%. In the tilt subgroup\nof the SUP 2 study,292 among 38 patients with dominant cardioinhibi-\ntory reflex (with a mean asystolic pause of 22 ± 16 s) the estimated\nrates of syncope recurrence with pacing were 3% at 1 year, 17% at 2\nyears, and 23% at 3 years; these figures were significantly lower than\nthe corresponding rates observed in untreated controls, and were\nsimilar to those observed in patients with CSS or with ECG-\ndocumented asystole. In a recent multicentre crossover RCT per-\nformed in 46 patients aged >40 years, affected by severely recurrent\n(>5 episodes during life) cardioinhibitory VVS,303 during 24-month\nfollow-up, syncope recurred in 4 (9%) patients treated with a dual-\nFigure 10 Summary of indications for pacing in patients with reflex syncope.

The SUP 2 study population was characterized by higher\nmean age, history of recurrent syncope beginning in middle or\nolder age, and frequent injuries, probably due to presentation\nwithout warning.292\nOwing to the contrasting results of the randomized trials, the\nestimated benefit of dual-chamber pacing in cardioinhibitory\ntilt-positive patients is weak. Divergence of opinion exists\namong experts. Further research is very likely to have an\nimportant impact on recommendations. Conversely, there is\nstrong consensus that pacing cannot be offered to patients\nwith non-cardioinhibitory tilt-positive response, and further\ntests (e.g. ILR) are warranted to document the mechanism of\nthe spontaneous reflex.\n5.2.6.4 Evidence from trials in patients with adenosine-sensitive syncope\nUnder this term, classified as a non-classical form of reflex syn-\ncope in Table 3, different clinical conditions are included, which\nhave a supposed role of adenosine in the genesis of syncope in\ncommon.\nA new clinical entity, called idiopathic AV block, has recently\nbeen described in patients with a long history of syncope and in\nwhom paroxysmal AV block could be recorded at the time of syn-\ncope recurrence.5 These patients had an otherwise normal heart\nand no sign of conduction disease on ECG and EPS; they had very\nlow plasma adenosine levels and a high induction rate of transient\ncomplete heart block during exogenous injections of adenosine.\nNo syncope recurrence was observed after permanent cardiac\npacing over very long periods of follow-up and there was no per-\nmanent AV block.\nSimilarly, the entity of ‘low-adenosine syncope’ has recently\nbeen described in patients who have an otherwise unexplained\nsyncope with sudden onset without prodrome, a normal heart,\nand normal ECG.4 The clinical, laboratory, and biological features\nof these patients are similar to those observed in patients\naffected by idiopathic paroxysmal AV block. Unlike in VVS, tilt\ntesting is usually negative.4,226 No syncope recurrence was\nobserved after permanent cardiac pacing in 10 patients who had\nECG documentation of asystolic pause due to sinus arrest or AV\nblock.286\nIn a small multicentre trial227 performed in 80 highly selected eld-\nerly patients with unexplained unpredictable syncope who had a pos-\nitive response to intravenous injection of a bolus of 20 mg of ATP,\ndual-chamber cardiac pacing significantly reduced the 2-year syncope\nrecurrence rate from 69% in the control group to 23% in the active\ngroup.\nThere is weak evidence that dual-chamber cardiac pacing\nmay be useful in reducing recurrences of syncope in patients\nwith the clinical features of adenosine-sensitive syncope.\nThe documentation of possible bradyarrhythmia in sponta-\nneous syncope remains the preferred eligibility criterion for\npacing.\n5.2.6.5 Choice of pacing mode\nIn CSS, a few small controlled studies304,305 and one registry306\nshowed that dual-chamber pacing is better than the single chamber\nventricular mode in counteracting BP fall during CSM and in prevent-\ning symptom recurrences. Even if the quality of evidence is weak,\ndual-chamber pacing is widely preferred in clinical practice.\nIn patients with VVS, dual-chamber pacing was used mostly with\na rate drop response feature that instituted rapid dual-chamber\npacing if the device detected a rapid decrease in HR. A compari-\nson between dual-chamber closed-loop stimulation and conven-\ntional dual-chamber pacing has been performed by means of a\ncrossover design in two small studies; these studies showed fewer\nsyncope recurrences with closed-loop stimulation, both in the\nacute setting during repeated tilt testing307 and during 18-month\nclinical follow-up.308\n5.2.6.6 Selection of patients for pacing and proposed algorithm\nThe fact that pacing is effective does not mean that it is always neces-\nsary. In patients with reflex syncope, cardiac pacing should be the last\nchoice and should only be considered in highly selected patients, i.e.\nthose >_40 years of age (mostly >60 years), affected by severe forms\nof reflex syncope with frequent recurrences associated with a\nhigh risk of injury, often due to the lack of prodrome.186 While there\nis growing scepticism over the diagnostic accuracy of tilt testing for\nsyncope diagnosis, emerging evidence supports the use of tilt testing\nfor the assessment of reflex hypotensive susceptibility132, which may be\nconsidered to identify patients with an associated hypotensive\nresponse who would be less likely to respond to permanent cardiac\npacing (see section 4.2.2.2). In a meta-analysis309 of individual patient\ndata from four studies performed in patients with asystolic reflex\nsyncope documented by an ILR, the estimated 3-year recurrence\nrate of syncope was 2% (95% CI ± 4%) in tilt-negative patients and\n33% (95% CI ± 20%) in tilt-positive patients; a positive tilt test\nresponse was the only significant predictor of syncope recurrence\nwith a hazard ratio of 4.3. Patients with hypotensive susceptibility\nshould need measures directed to counteract hypotensive suscepti-\nbility in addition to cardiac pacing, e.g. the discontinuation/reduction\nof hypotensive drugs and the administration of fludrocortisone or\nmidodrine.\nThe algorithm shown in Figure 11 has recently been prospectively\nvalidated in a multicentre pragmatic study, which showed a low\nrecurrence rate of syncope with pacing of 9% at 1 year and 15% at 2\nyears, significantly lower than the 22% and 37%, respectively,\nobserved in unpaced controls.186\nESC Guidelines\n1917\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/39/21/1883/4939241 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\nTreatment of reﬂex syncope\nRecommendations\nClassa\nLevelb\nEducation and lifestyle modiﬁcations\nExplanation of the diagnosis, the provision of reassurance, and explanation of the risk of recurrence and the avoidance of\ntriggers and situations are indicated in all patients.

Younger patients are those aged <40 years while older patients are >60 years, with an overlap between 40\nand 60 years. Severity of reflex syncope is defined in the text. The duration of prodrome is largely subjective and imprecise. A value of <5 s distinguishes\n_\narrhythmic from reflex syncope49; in patients without structural heart disease, a duration >10 s can distinguish reflex syncope from cardiac syncope.38\nIn practice, the prodrome is ‘absent or very short’ if it does not allow patients enough time to act, such as to sit or lie down. The heading’ low BP phe-\nnotype’ identifies patients with chronic low BP values (in general, systolic around 110 mmHg, who have a clear history of orthostatic intolerance and\northostatic VVS). The group ‘dominant cardioinhibition‘ identifies patients in whom clinical features and results of tests suggest that sudden cardioinhibi-\ntion is mainly responsible for syncope.

Ambulatory BP recordings may\nbe helpful in identifying abnormal diurnal patterns. These recordings may\nalso help identify supine or nocturnal hypertension in treated patients.\n5.3.2 Adequate hydration and salt intake\nThe expansion of extracellular volume is an important goal. In the\nabsence of hypertension, patients should be instructed to have a sufficient\nsalt and water intake, targeting 2–3 L of fluids per day and 10 g of sodium\nchloride.310 Rapid ingestion of cool water is reported to be effective in\ncombating orthostatic intolerance and postprandial hypotension.311\n5.3.3 Discontinuation/reduction of vasoactive drugs\nSeveral studies that have evaluated the association of vasoactive\ndrugs (i.e. any antihypertensive agents, nitrates, diuretics, neuroleptic\nantidepressants,\nor\ndopaminergic\ndrugs)\nwith\nOH\nand\nfalls\nhave yielded contrasting results.312 However, intensely prescribed\nantihypertensive therapy can increase the risk of OH. Intensive anti-\nhypertensive treatment can be defined as higher doses of antihyper-\ntensive medications, an increased number of antihypertensive\ndrugs, or lowering BP to a target <140/90 mmHg. The total\nnumber of BP-lowering medications313 or the use of three or more\nantihypertensive drugs may be a significant predictor of OH.314\nAngiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptors\nblockers, and calcium channel blockers are less likely to be associated\nwith OH compared with beta-blockers and thiazide diuretics.315–318\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\nAsystolic\ntilt testing?\nFigure 11 Decision pathway for cardiac pacing in patients with reflex syncope.

The quality of evi-\ndence is moderate. Longer-term future RCTs are likely to have\nan important impact on determining the net risk2benefit ratio\nof the withdrawal of culprit medications.\n5.3.4 Counter-pressure manoeuvres\nPCM such as leg crossing and squatting should be encouraged in\npatients with warning symptoms who are able to perform them.319\n5.3.5 Abdominal binders and/or support stockings\nGravitational venous pooling in older patients can be treated with\nabdominal binders or compression stockings.23,320,321\n5.3.6 Head-up tilt sleeping\nSleeping with the head of the bed elevated (>10 degrees) prevents\nnocturnal polyuria, maintains a more favourable distribution of body\nfluids, and ameliorates nocturnal hypertension.104,322,323\n5.3.7 Midodrine\nThe alpha-agonist midodrine is a useful addition to first-line treatment\nin patients with chronic autonomic failure. It cannot be regarded as a\ncure, nor is it helpful in all affected patients, but it is very useful in\nsome. There is no doubt that midodrine increases BP both in the\nsupine and upright posture, and ameliorates the symptoms of OH.\nMidodrine (2.5–10 mg t.i.d) was shown to be effective in three\nrandomized placebo-controlled trials.324–326\nThe desirable effects of midodrine outweigh the undesirable\neffects. The quality of evidence is moderate and further research\nis likely to have an important impact on the estimate of benefit.\n5.3.8 Fludrocortisone\nFludrocortisone (0.1–0.3 mg once daily) is a mineralocorticoid that\nstimulates renal sodium retention and expands fluid volume.327 The\nevidence in favour of fludrocortisone is from two small observational\nstudies (in combination with head-up sleeping) and one double-blind\ntrial in 60 patients; the observational studies showed haemodynamic\nbenefit and, in the trial, treated patients were less symptomatic with\nhigher BP.322,327,328\nThe desirable effects of fludrocortisone outweigh the undesirable\neffects. The quality of evidence is moderate and further research\nis likely to have an important impact on the estimate of benefit.\n5.3.9 Additional therapies\nAdditional and less frequently used treatments, alone or in combina-\ntion, include desmopressin in patients with nocturnal polyuria,\noctreotide in postprandial hypotension, erythropoietin in anaemia,\npyridostigmine, the use of walking sticks, frequent small meals, and\nthe judicious exercise of leg and abdominal muscles, especially swim-\nming. Their efficacy is less established.104\n5.3.10 Emerging new pharmacological therapy in specific\nsubgroups\nDroxidopa, a precursor of norepinephrine, is a centrally and periph-\nerally acting alpha/beta-agonist approved by the US Food and Drug\nAdministration for the treatment of symptomatic neurogenic OH.\nDroxidopa has recently been investigated for the treatment of neu-\nrogenic OH in four short-term RCTs329–332 with a total of 485\npatients. They showed a modest increase in standing systolic BP and\nthe symptom benefit of droxidopa over placebo regarding some\nitems of quality of life after 2 weeks of treatment, but its benefit was\nFigure 12 Schematic practical guide for the treatment of orthostatic hypotension.\n1920\nESC Guidelines\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/39/21/1883/4939241 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n..........................................................................................................................................................................\nlost after 8 weeks.333 Thus, current evidence is insufficient to confirm\nthe efficacy of droxidopa for long-term use.\n5.4 Cardiac arrhythmias as the primary\ncause\n5.4.1 Syncope due to intrinsic sinoatrial or\natrioventricular conduction system disease\nCurrent management strategies in patients with syncope due to\nintrinsic cardiac bradycardia are summarized in Figure 13.\n5.4.1.1 Sinus node disease\nIn general, cardiac pacemaker therapy is indicated and has proved\neffective in intrinsic sinus node disease when intermittent sinus arrest\nor sinoatrial block has been demonstrated to account for syncope by\nmeans of ECG documentation during spontaneous syncope.334–338\nA frequent situation is that of patients who have prolonged sinus\npause following the termination of tachycardia in bradycar-\ndia-tachycardia syndrome due to the abnormally prolonged time\nneeded for the recovery of automaticity by a diseased sinus node.\nPermanent pacing does not affect survival.\nWhen the correlation between symptoms and ECG is estab-\nlished, there is general consensus that cardiac pacing is effec-\ntive and useful for symptom relief.\nIn the absence of the above situations, despite adequate pacing, syn-\ncope recurs in approximately 15–28% of patients at 5 years339–341\n(see Supplementary Data Table 9). This is due to the frequent associa-\ntion of a vasodepressor reflex mechanism with sinus node disease. In\npatients with sinus node disease and syncope, carotid sinus hypersen-\nsitivity and a positive response to tilt are present in <_50% of patients.\nThus, an increased susceptibility to neurally mediated bradycardia/\nhypotension is often the cause of syncope.135,136 A reflex mechanism\nof syncope fits well with the unpredictable natural history of syncope\nrecurrence. Physicians should be aware that effectiveness of therapy is\nnot well documented in such cases. From a practical perspective, car-\ndiac pacing may be a reasonable solution in patients affected by sinus\nnode disease, who have had documentation of an asymptomatic ven-\ntricular pause >3 s (with exceptions for young trained persons, during\nsleep, and medicated patients), when a competitive diagnosis, i.e.\nhypotension, can be ruled out.294 An abnormal SNRT enhances the\nprobability of efficacy of cardiac pacing (see section 4.2.6.1).210–212\nWhen the correlation between symptoms and ECG is not\nestablished, cardiac pacing may be reasonable in patients with\nintrinsic sinus node disease, syncope, and documentation of\nasymptomatic pause(s).\nThe elimination of drugs that may exacerbate or unmask an underly-\ning susceptibility to bradycardia is an important element in preventing\nsyncope recurrence. Percutaneous cardiac ablative techniques for\nthe control of atrial tachyarrhythmia have become of increasing\nimportance in selected patients with the bradycardia-tachycardia\nform of sick sinus syndrome, but are infrequently used for the pre-\nvention of syncope.\n5.4.1.2 Atrioventricular conduction system disease\nCardiac pacing is the treatment of syncope associated with sympto-\nmatic AV block (Figure 13). Although formal RCTs of pacing in third-\nor second-degree type 2 AV block have not been performed, some\nobservational studies suggest that pacing is highly effective in prevent-\ning syncope recurrences when AV block is documented. Langenfeld\net al.341 observed a decline in the rate of syncope from 44 to 3.4%\nover 5-year follow-up in 115 patients paced for AV block; the recur-\nrence rate was 7% in the subgroup with syncope before pacemaker\nimplantation. More recently, Sud et al.200 reported no syncope recur-\nrence, and Aste et al.255 reported a recurrence of 1% at 5 years after\npacemaker implantation among 73 patients with documented\nTreatment of orthostatic hypotension\nRecommendations\nClassa\nLevelb\nExplanation of the diagnosis, the provision\nof reassurance, and explanation of the risk\nof recurrence and the avoidance of triggers\nand situations are indicated in all patients.\nI\nC\nAdequate hydration and salt intake are\nindicated.310,311\nI\nC\nModiﬁcation or discontinuation of hypoten-\nsive drug regimens should be\nconsidered.312–318\nIIa\nB\nIsometric PCM should be considered.319\nIIa\nC\nAbdominal binders and/or support stockings\nto reduce venous pooling should be\nconsidered.23,320,321\nIIa\nB\nHead-up tilt sleeping (>10 degrees) to\nincrease ﬂuid volume should be\nconsidered.104,322,323\nIIa\nC\nMidodrine should be considered if symp-\ntoms persist.324–326\nIIa\nB\nFludrocortisone should be considered if\nsymptoms persist.322,327,328\nIIa\nC\nAdditional advice and clinical perspectives\n• In individuals with established OH and risk factors for falls,\naggressive BP-lowering treatment should be avoided; their\ntreatment targets should be revised to a systolic BP value of\n140–150 mmHg and medication withdrawal should be\nconsidered.\n• The BP-lowering agents (angiotensin-converting enzyme\ninhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and calcium channel\nblockers) should be used preferentially, especially among\npatients at high risk of falls, as diuretics and beta-blockers are\nassociated with OH and falls and should be avoided in at-risk\nindividuals.\nBP = blood pressure; OH = orthostatic hypotension; PCM = physical counter-\npressure manoeuvres.\naClass of recommendation.\nbLevel of evidence.\nESC Guidelines\n1921\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/39/21/1883/4939241 by guest on 14 January 2026",

Nevertheless, less than half of the\npatients with bifascicular BBB and syncope will have a final diagnosis\nof AV block, a similar percentage will have a final diagnosis of reflex\nsyncope, and, in approximately 15%, the cause will remain unex-\nplained at the end of a complete workup.342 In addition, among\npatients receiving an ILR, approximately half remained free of syn-\ncope for >2 years after the implantation.187,188,342,343 Conversely,\nimplantation of a pacemaker without documentation of AV block\n(empirical pacing) exposed patients to the risk of recurrence of syn-\ncope in about one-quarter of cases during long-term follow-up and\nwas unnecessary in another half.217,344 Thus, only one in four pace-\nmakers will finally be appropriate. Finally, pacemaker treatment has\nnot been proven to have a survival benefit. The above considerations\njustify a class IIb indication in the ESC Guidelines on pacing.294\nTo overcome the above problems, ESC Guidelines on pacing294—\nin patients with LVEF >35%—recommend a strategy of EPS followed\nby ILR if the EPS findings are unremarkable. With this strategy, a pace-\nmaker was implanted in approximately half of the patients and these\npatients had syncope recurrence after pacemaker implantation in\n0–7% of cases188,217. This strategy was safe; however, this Task Force\nrecognizes that in the ‘real world’, an empirical pacemaker may be\nacceptable in selected patients at high risk of traumatic recurrence\n(e.g. elderly patients with unpredictable syncopes) and that an individ-\nual risk–benefit evaluation is warranted (Figure 14).\nEven if the quality of evidence is moderate, there is strong con-\nsensus that in patients with bifascicular BBB with a positive EPS\nor documentation of paroxysmal AV block during prolonged\nECG monitoring, cardiac pacing is highly effective in preventing\nsyncope recurrence. The evidence of efficacy of empirical pac-\ning strategy is weak and the estimate of benefit is uncertain.\nAlthough syncope is not associated with an increased incidence of sud-\nden death in patients with preserved cardiac function, a high incidence\nof total deaths (about one-third sudden) was observed in patients with\nBBB and heart failure, previous myocardial infarction, or low ejection\nfraction.345–347 Indeed, the high total and sudden mortality seems to be\nmainly related to underlying structural heart disease and ventricular\ntachyarrhythmias. In this latter situation, syncope is a risk factor, rather\nthan the cause, of death.218 Unfortunately, ventricular programmed\nstimulation does not seem to identify these patients correctly, and the\nfinding of inducible ventricular arrhythmia (VA) should therefore be\ninterpreted with caution.345,346 Therefore, an implantable cardioverter\ndefibrillator (ICD) or a cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator is\nindicated in patients with BBB, congestive heart failure, or previous\nmyocardial infarction and depressed systolic function for the preven-\ntion of SCD, but may be unable to prevent the recurrence of syncope,\nwhich is often due to non-arrhythmic causes such as OH or vasode-\npressor reflex. The strategy for the management of patients with unex-\nplained syncope and BBB is summarized in Figure 14.\n5.4.2 Syncope due to intrinsic cardiac tachyarrhythmias\nCurrent management strategies in patients with syncope due to\nintrinsic cardiac tachyarrhythmia are summarized in Figure 15.\n°\n°\nFigure 13 Summary of indications for pacing in patients with syncope due to intrinsic cardiac bradycardia.

In patients\nwith syncope associated with atrial fibrillation or atypical left atrial\nflutter, the decision should be individualized.\n5.4.2.2 Paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia\nSyncope due to torsade de pointes is not uncommon and is, in its\nacquired form, the result of drugs that prolong the QT interval.\nTreatment is the immediate discontinuation of the suspected drug.\nCatheter ablation or drug therapy is recommended in patients\nwith syncope due to VT in the presence or absence of structural\nheart disease in order to prevent syncope recurrence (Figure 15).\nDetailed guidelines regarding antiarrhythmic drug usage in patients\nFigure 14 Therapeutic algorithm for patients presenting with unexplained syncope and bundle branch block.

Structural cardiac or\ncardiopulmonary disease can be present in some patients with syn-\ncope, and its incidence increases in older patients. The mere presence\nof heart disease does not imply that syncope is related to the underly-\ning cardiac disorder. Some of these patients have typical reflex syn-\ncope; in others, such as those with inferior myocardial infarction or\naortic stenosis, the underlying cardiac disease may play a role in trig-\ngering or potentiating a reflex mechanism, and—finally—the underly-\ning cardiac disease may be the substrate for conduction disturbances,\nsupraventricular arrhythmia, or VA that causes syncope.\nEven in the absence of specific trials, there is strong consensus\nthat with syncope secondary to structural cardiac disease, the\ngoal of treatment is not only to prevent syncopal recurrence, but\nto treat the underlying disease and decrease the risk of death.\n5.6 Treatment of unexplained syncope in\npatients at high risk of sudden cardiac\ndeath\nThe underlying clinical situation is that of a patient being evaluated for\nICD implantation because they are affected by syncope(s) supposedly\ndue to transient self-terminating ventricular tachyarrhythmias (fast VT or\nVF), which have not yet been documented because of their short dura-\ntion.349 Syncope due to documented VT/VF is outside the scope of this\nsection; please refer to section 5.4.2. General guidance may be sought in\nthe 2015 ESC Guidelines for VA and the prevention of SCD.46\n5.6.1 Definition\nIn general, a history of syncope in patients with structural heart\ndisease or inheritable arrhythmia syndromes is associated with a\ntwo- to four-fold increased risk of death,348,350–353 but varies\nbetween specific conditions.354–356 Moreover, there have been\nvery few studies on ICDs in patients with syncope associated with\nleft ventricular dysfunction,31,348 cardiomyopathy, or inheritable\narrhythmia syndromes.357 In these Guidelines, we complement\nprevious ESC Guidelines for VA and the prevention of SCD46 by\nproviding a precise definition of unexplained syncope, and making\nrecommendations for its investigation and management in differ-\nent clinical settings.\n• For this section, ‘unexplained syncope‘ is defined as syncope that\ndoes not meet any class I diagnostic criterion defined in the\ntables of recommendations in section 4. In the presence of clini-\ncal features described in this section, unexplained syncope is con-\nsidered a ‘suspected arrhythmic syncope’.\nWhen the mechanism of syncope is non-arrhythmic, the manage-\nment of patients at high risk of SCD is the same as for patients with-\nout syncope.\n5.6.2 Left ventricular systolic dysfunction\nThe benefit of an ICD to reduce the risk of death is established. Thus,\npatients with unexplained syncope who have an established ICD indi-\ncation per current Guidelines46 must receive an ICD before, and\nindependently of, the evaluation of the mechanism of syncope, even if\nthe mechanism of syncope is unknown or uncertain at the end of a\ncomplete workup. While this strategy may help to prolong life,\npatients often remain at risk of recurrent syncope, implying a need\nfor precise identification of the mechanism of syncope and specific\ntreatment when possible.\nFew data exist concerning the prevalence and the prognostic impli-\ncations of unexplained syncope in unselected patients with left ven-\ntricular dysfunction or non-ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy with\nImplantable cardioverter deﬁbrillator indications in\npatients with unexplained syncopea and left ventricular\nsystolic dysfunction\nRecommendations\nClassb\nLevelc\nICD therapy is recommended to reduce\nSCD in patients with symptomatic heart fail-\nure (NYHA class II–III) and LVEF <_35% after\n>_3 months of optimal medical therapy, who\nare expected to survive >_1 year with good\nfunctional status.46\nI\nA\nAn ICD should be considered in patients\nwith unexplained syncopea with systolic\nimpairment, but without a current indication\nfor ICD, to reduce the risk of sudden\ndeath.27,28,359,360\nIIa\nC\nInstead of an ICD, an ILR may be considered\nin patients with recurrent episodes of unex-\nplained syncopea with systolic impairment,\nbut without a current indication for ICD.\nIIb\nC\nAdditional advice and clinical perspectives\n• The presence of syncope increases mortality regardless of its\ncause.348 Thus, syncope is a risk factor for life-threatening\nevents.\n• The decision to implant an ICD or to complete the\ninvestigation (e.g. ILR implantation) in patients with unex-\nplained syncope depends on a global clinical evaluation\nof the patient’s conditions, the potential beneﬁt and harm\nof such therapy, and the presence of other risk factors\nfor SCD.\nICD = implantable cardioverter deﬁbrillator; ILR = implantable loop recorder;\nLVEF = left ventricular ejection fraction; NYHA = New York Heart Association;\nSCD = sudden cardiac death.\naUnexplained syncope is deﬁned as syncope that does not meet a class I diagnos-\ntic criterion deﬁned in the tables of recommendations in section 4.

In a systematic review, the average haz-\nard ratio of unexplained syncope (irrespective of definition) was 2.68\n(95% CI 0.97–4.38).361 In the largest multicentre study to date\n(>3600 patients with HCM), syncope was an independent predictor\nof the composite of SCD and ICD discharge (hazard ratio 2.05, 95%\nCI 1.48–2.82).350 A prophylactic ICD is appropriate in individuals\nwith other features indicative of a high risk of SCD that are used to\nestimate the 5-year risk of SCD using the HCM Risk-SCD model245;\nthey include: age, family history of SCD, maximum left ventricular\nwall thickness, left atrial diameter, and non-sustained VT.\n5.6.4 Arrhythmogenic right ventricular\ncardiomyopathy\nAlthough limited and diverse, current data suggest that unexplained syn-\ncope is a marker of arrhythmic risk in patients with ARVC.46,351,362,363\nThe decision to implant an ICD should take into account the other\nknown risk factors for arrhythmic events46: frequent non-sustained VT,\nfamily history of premature sudden death, extensive right ventricular\ndisease, marked QRS prolongation, late gadolinium enhancement on\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (including left ventricular involve-\nment), left ventricular dysfunction, and VT induction during EPS.46\n5.6.5 Patients with inheritable arrhythmogenic disorders\n5.6.5.1 Long QT syndrome\nSyncopal events in long QT syndrome (LQTS) are associated with an\nincreased risk of subsequent cardiac arrest. The annual rate of SCD in\npatients with untreated LQTS is around 0.9% overall and 5% for those\nwith syncope.352,364 Beta-blocker therapy substantially reduces the risk\nof syncope and SCD, but presentation with cardiac arrest and recur-\nrent syncope during beta-blocker therapy is associated with the same\nrisk of fatal events as in untreated patients.46 For this reason, ICD treat-\nment should be considered in patients with LQTS and recurrent unex-\nplained syncope despite beta-blocker therapy, especially in cases of\ngood treatment compliance, in the absence of precipitating factors,\nand in LQT2 and LQT3 syndromes. Left cardiac sympathetic denerva-\ntion should also be considered in this situation, particularly in LQT1.46\n5.6.5.2 Brugada syndrome\nA history of syncope may increase the risk of arrhythmic events up to\ntwo- to three-fold compared with that in asymptomatic patients.

If the family history is positive,\ngenetic causes of electrical disease of the heart should be consid-\nered first. Some children with reflex syncope also have a positive\nfamily history.400 Tilt testing seems to have high false-negative and\nfalse-positive rates and should be used with caution for the pri-\nmary identification of reflex syncope. Since tilt protocols com-\nmonly used in adults may lack specificity in teenagers, in one study,\na shorter tilt test duration of 10 min at 60 or 70 degrees was used\nand showed a specificity of >85%.401\nIn young patients, syncope can rarely be the initial manifestation of\nunusual but life-threatening conditions such as LQTS, Kearns–Sayre\nsyndrome (external ophthalmoplegia and progressive heart block),\nBrugada\nsyndrome,\ncatecholaminergic\npolymorphic\nVT,\nWolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, ARVC, HCM, pulmonary arterial\nhypertension, myocarditis, arrhythmia after repaired congenital heart\ndisease, and anomalous origin of a coronary artery.\nSome aspects of the history can suggest a cardiac origin, and\nshould prompt cardiac evaluation.\n• Family history: premature SCD at age <40 years and/or familial\nheart disease.\n• Known or suspected heart disease.\n• Event triggers: loud noise, fright, and/or extreme emotional\nstress.\n• Syncope during exercise, including swimming.\n• Syncope without prodromes, while supine or sleeping, or pre-\nceded by chest pain or palpitations.\n6.2.2. Therapy\nThe therapeutic approach is the same as in adults. However, it should\nbe stressed that the effectiveness of pharmacological agents and tilt\ntraining for recurrent reflex syncope is undetermined in the absence\nof well-designed paediatric trials. Furthermore, even in the presence\nof VVS with prolonged asystole, pacemakers should be avoided due\nto the relatively transient and benign nature of the syndrome.402\nIn summary, the key points for the evaluation of syncope in paedi-\natrics are as follows:\n• Syncope in childhood is common, the majority being of reflex\norigin, with only a minority having a potentially life-threatening\ncause.\n• Discriminating benign from serious causes is made primarily by\nhistory, physical examination, and ECG results.\n• Children with a history suggesting VVS, a normal ECG, and no\nfamily history of arrhythmia should not undergo further cardiac\ninvestigations.\n• The cornerstone of therapy for young patients with reflex syn-\ncope includes education and reassurance.\n7. Psychogenic transient loss of\nconsciousness and its evaluation\nIn psychogenic TLOC there is no gross somatic brain dysfunction,\nbut the attacks fulfil the criteria for TLOC (see section 3.1). There\nare two types: PPS and PNES. In PPS movements are absent, so\nPPS resembles syncope or longer-lasting LOC, whereas in PNES\nimpressive limb movements mean the attacks resemble epileptic\nseizures. PPS and PNES differ pathophysiologically from the\nTLOC forms that they resemble: in PPS, BP and HR are normal or\nhigh rather than low, and the EEG is normal instead of showing\nthe slowing or flattening typical of syncope; in contrast to epileptic\nseizures, the EEG in PNES shows no epileptiform brain activity\nduring an attack.9,116\nThe frequency of PPS and PNES probably depends on the\nsetting. The rate of PPS varies from 1% of patients referred to\ngeneral syncope clinics94 to 8% of patients referred to specialist\nneurological\nclinics,116\nbut\nPPS\nis\nprobably\ninsufficiently\nrecognized.154\n7.1 Diagnosis\n7.1.1 Historical criteria for attacks\nThe presence of a psychological trauma is not a prerequisite for a\ndiagnosis of conversion. The diagnosis of PPS rests on positive clues\ntaken from the patient’s history and from documenting normal EEG\nresults, HR, or BP during an attack. History taking in PPS usually\nreveals a combination of the following features116,154,403:\n(1)\nIn most cases, the duration of PPS is as short as in syncope, but a\nmuch longer duration is a useful diagnostic finding: patients may lie\nimmobile on the floor for 15–30 min.\n(2)\nThe eyes are usually open in epileptic seizures and syncope but are\nusually closed in psychogenic TLOC.\n(3)\nThe attack frequency is high, with several attacks occurring over a\nweek or in a day.\n(4)\nThere is usually no recognisable trigger, and no sweating, pallor, or\nnausea beforehand.\n(5)\nInjury does not exclude PNES or PPS.\nThese features should occur together in most attacks. The pres-\nence of another pattern of features suggesting a true syncope type,\nusually VVS, does not argue against a diagnosis of PPS.\n7.1.2 Documentation of key features during an attack\nThe following features are relevant during an attack:\n• Video recording or clinical observation, including provocation of\nan attack during tilt testing. Primary features: sleep-like body posi-\ntion with closed eyes and lack of response to speech or touch, if\nESC Guidelines\n1929\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/39/21/1883/4939241 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n.............................................................................................................................................................................\ntested. Secondary features: subtle signs incompatible with LOC\nsuch as eyelid flicker, eyeball movements, swallowing, intact\nmuscle tone, normal movements absent in true unconsciousness,\nand resistance to eye opening.\n• BP: normal or elevated during TLOC.\n• EEG: normal waking eye-closed EEG pattern, i.e. usually with\nalpha activity, during TLOC.\nThe gold standard for PPS is documenting an attack with a home\nvideo recorder or with a tilt testing during which BP, HR, and EEG\nare normal.116,204,404 The gold standard for PNES is documenting an\nattack with video-EEG monitoring.204,404\n7.1.2.1 Management of psychogenic pseudosyncope\nAnnouncing a psychological diagnosis to patients may be considered\ndifficult, but is necessary for reasons of honesty and as the first step of\ntreatment.404 It should be done by the somatic specialist who diagnoses\nPPS.116,404 Important aspects are to assure patients that they are taken\nseriously and that attacks are as involuntary as syncope or an epileptic\nseizure. Acceptance of the diagnosis by patients may be critical for ther-\napy.

The first form concerns ictal asystole. Whereas approx-\nimately 90% of all epileptic seizures are accompanied by\ntachycardia, ictal bradycardia and asystole occur in 0.3–0.5% of\nseizures.412,413 Bradycardia precedes asystole and AV block may\noccur, resembling the ECG pattern of reflex syncope.412,414\nEpileptic asystole occurs during partial complex seizures, not dur-\ning generalized seizures. Epileptic asystole occurs in only a fraction\nof the seizures of one person, and then occurs after a variable\ninterval of 5–100 s from seizure onset.415,416 If asystole lasts for\nmore than about 8 s, syncope ensues.416 A typical history is for a\npartial complex seizure to progress as usual for that patient, and\nthen the patient suddenly falls flaccidly, with or without brief myo-\nclonic jerking.416,417 Ictal bradycardia, asystole, and ictal AV block\nare likely self-terminating,412 and are due to vagal activation\nbrought about by the seizure.

Therapy\nrequires\nanti-epileptic\ndrugs\nand\npossibly\na\npacemaker.418\nIctal asystole is probably not involved in sudden death in epilepsy,\nas this typically occurs in patients after unwitnessed nocturnal\ngeneralized tonic-clonic seizures, i.e. another type of epi-\nlepsy.414,419 Note that most cases of sudden cardiac arrest in\npatients with epilepsy are due to cardiovascular disease and not to\nictal asystole.420\nThe second form concerns a syncopal epileptic seizure.\nHypoxia can trigger epileptic seizures.208,421 Such syncopal epilep-\ntic seizures have been described in infants with reflex syncope\nor cyanotic breath-holding spells. A typical syncopal spell\nsuddenly transforms into prolonged clonic movements that\nlast for minutes; note that shorter epileptic seizures may remain\nunnoticed.\n8.1.3 Cerebrovascular disorders\nIn general, a TIA concerns a focal neurological deficit without LOC,\nand syncope the opposite.

A TIA may occur when\nflow through the vertebral artery cannot supply both the arm and\npart of the brain during forceful use of the arm. Steal most often\naffects the left side. When detected with ultrasound, steal is asympto-\nmatic in 64% of cases.422 A TIA is likely due to steal only when it is\nvertebrobasilar (see below) and associated with exercise of one arm.\nThere are no reliable reports of isolated LOC without focal neuro-\nlogical symptoms and signs in subclavian steal.\nA TIA related to a carotid artery does not usually cause TLOC. An\nexception concerns orthostatic TIAs, concerning a combination of\nmultiple stenoses of cerebral arteries and OH. This may rarely result\nin repetitive, orthostatic, short-lasting, and stereotyped TIAs.423,424\nA TIA of the vertebrobasilar system can cause LOC, but there are\nalways focal signs, usually limb weakness, gait and limb ataxia, vertigo,\ndiplopia, nystagmus, dysarthria, and oropharyngeal dysfunction.\nFewer than 1% of patients with vertebrobasilar ischaemia present\nwith a single presenting symptom.425\n8.1.4 Migraine\nSyncope, presumable VVS, and orthostatic intolerance occur more\noften in patients with migraine, who have a higher lifetime prevalence\nof syncope and often frequent syncope.426 In migraineurs, syncope\nand migraine attacks rarely occur simultaneously.\nTable 10\nDifferentiating syncope from epileptic seizures9,50,410,411\nClinical feature\nSyncope\nEpileptic seizures\nUseful features\nPresence of trigger\nVery often\nRare\nNature of trigger\nDiffers between types: pain, standing, emo-\ntions for VVS; speciﬁc trigger for situational\nsyncope; standing for OH\nFlashing lights is best known; also range of rare\ntriggers\nProdromes\nOften presyncope (autonomic activation in\nreﬂex syncope, light-headedness in OH, palpi-\ntations in cardiac syncope)\nEpileptic aura: repetitive, speciﬁc for each patient.\nIncludes de´j\u0003a vu.

Cataplexy is a key feature of narcolepsy; other\ncardinal symptoms are excessive daytime sleepiness, sleep-onset\nparalysis, and hypnagogic hallucinations. Cataplexy may be mistaken\nfor syncope, but also for PPS: a partial awareness of events may be\npresent in PPS, and the falls of cataplexy are partly controlled because\nparalysis need not be immediately complete.\n8.1.6 Drop attacks\nThe term drop attacks is confusing as it is variably used for\nMenie`re’s disease, atonic epileptic seizures, and unexplained\nfalls.387 A specific condition also labelled drop attacks concerns\nmiddle-aged women (rarely men) who suddenly find themselves\nfalling.428 They usually remember hitting the floor and can stand\nup immediately afterwards.\n8.2 Neurological tests\nA schematic comprehensive figure of neurological tests used for\nautonomic failure is shown in Figure 17.\n8.2.1 Electroencephalography\nThe results of interictal EEGs are normal in syncope.410,430 An interic-\ntal normal EEG cannot rule out epilepsy and the EEG in epilepsy\nmust always be interpreted in a clinical context. An EEG is not rec-\nommended when syncope is the most likely cause of TLOC, but it is\nwhen epilepsy is the likely cause or when clinical data are equivocal.\nThe EEG is also useful to establish PPS, if recorded during a provoked\nattack.\n8.2.2 Brain computed tomography and magnetic\nresonance imaging\nComputed tomography and MRI in uncomplicated syncope should\nbe avoided. If neurological examination points out Parkinsonism,\nataxia, or cognitive impairment, MRI is recommended. In cases of\ncontraindication for MRI, computed tomography is recommended to\nexclude brain lesions.\n8.2.3 Neurovascular studies\nNo studies suggest that carotid Doppler ultrasonography is valuable\nin patients with typical syncope.\n8.2.4 Blood tests\nAn acute or subacute onset of multidomain autonomic failure sug-\ngests a paraneoplastic or autoimmune cause.

Cataplexy is a key feature of narcolepsy; other\ncardinal symptoms are excessive daytime sleepiness, sleep-onset\nparalysis, and hypnagogic hallucinations.

Fast-track\naccess with a separate waiting list and scheduled follow-up visits is\nrecommended. In particular, patients at low/intermediate risk admit-\nted to the ED should benefit from such fast-track facilities (so-called\nprotected discharge or advanced access with an appointment for\nearly assessment) to reduce hospitalization rates, directly from the\nED or after a short stay in the short observation unit of the ED (see\nsection 4.1.2).\n9.1.6 Outcomes and quality indicators\nThe EHRA Task Force63 has developed the following preliminary\nquality indicators, based on consensus, as a rough guide for\npractitioners:\n(1)\nAbsolute rate of undiagnosed TLOC should be reduced by 20%;\n(2)\nLess than 20% of low-/intermediate-risk TLOC patients should be\nadmitted from the ED;\n(3)\nThe syncope unit should have a 20% reduction in costs relative\nto usual practice and improved outcomes (i.e. <5% readmissions\nfor syncope and <20% of paced patients with recurrence at\n1 year).\n9.2 The clinical nurse specialist in the\nsyncope unit\n9.2.1 Definition\nThe syncope unit clinical nurse specialist is defined as an experienced\npractitioner who has sufficient knowledge of history features and\nphysical findings to recognize all major forms of TLOC, as well as syn-\ndromes of orthostatic intolerance. The clinical nurse specialist should\nwork in close collaboration with the syncope specialist.

Perform prolonged ECG monitoring (external or implantable) in\npatients with recurrent severe unexplained syncope who have all of\nthe following three features:\n\u0003 Clinical or ECG features suggesting arrhythmic syncope.\n\u0003 A high probability of recurrence of syncope in a reasonable time.\n\u0003 Who may benefit from a specific therapy if a cause for syncope is\nfound.\n10. Perform EPS in patients with unexplained syncope and bifascicular\nBBB (impending high-degree AV block) or suspected tachycardia.\n11. Perform an exercise stress test in patients who experience syncope\nduring or shortly after exertion.\n12. Consider basic autonomic function tests (Valsalva manoeuvre and\ndeep-breathing test) and ABPM for the assessment of autonomic\nfunction in patients with suspected neurogenic OH.\n13. Consider video recording (at home or in hospital) of TLOC sus-\npected to be of non-syncopal nature.\nTreatment\n14. To all patients with reflex syncope and OH, explain the diagnosis,\nreassure, explain the risk of recurrence, and give advice on how to\navoid triggers and situations. These measures are the cornerstone of\ntreatment and have a high impact in reducing the recurrence of\nsyncope.\n15. In patients with severe forms of reflex syncope, select one or more of\nthe following additional specific treatments according to the clinical\nfeatures:\n\u0003 Midodrine or fludrocortisone in young patients with low BP\nphenotype.\n\u0003 Counter-pressure manoeuvres (including tilt training if needed) in\nyoung patients with prodromes.\n\u0003 ILR-guided management strategy in selected patients without\nor with short prodromes.\n\u0003 Discontinuation/reduction of hypotensive therapy targeting a\nsystolic BP of 140 mmHg in old hypertensive patients.\n\u0003 Pacemaker implantation in old patients with dominant\ncardioinhibitory forms.\n16. In patients with OH, select one or more of the following additional\nspecific treatments according to clinical severity:\n\u0003 Education regarding lifestyle manoeuvres.\n\u0003 Adequate hydration and salt intake.\n\u0003 Discontinuation/reduction of hypotensive therapy.\n\u0003 Counter-pressure manoeuvres.\n\u0003 Abdominal binders and/or support stockings.\n\u0003 Head-up tilt sleeping.\n\u0003 Midodrine or fludrocortisone.\n17. Ensure that all patients with cardiac syncope receive the specific ther-\napy of the culprit arrhythmia and/or of the underlying disease.\n18. Balance the benefits and harm of ICD implantation in patients with\nunexplained syncope at high risk of SCD (e.g. those affected by left\nventricle systolic dysfunction, HCM, ARVC, or inheritable arrhyth-\nmogenic disorders). In this situation, unexplained syncope is defined as\nsyncope that does not meet any class I diagnostic criterion defined in\nthe tables of recommendations of the 2018 ESC Guidelines on syn-\ncope and is considered a suspected arrhythmic syncope.\n19. Re-evaluate the diagnostic process and consider alternative therapies\nif the above rules fail or are not applicable to an individual patient.\nBear in mind that Guidelines are only advisory. Even though they are\nbased on the best available scientific evidence, treatment should be\ntailored to an individual patient’s need.\n11. Gaps in evidence and areas for\nfuture research\nClinicians responsible for managing patients with TLOC must fre-\nquently make treatment decisions without adequate evidence or a\nconsensus of expert opinion. The following is a short list of selected,\ncommon issues that deserve to be addressed in future clinical\nresearch.\nDiagnosis: the gap between the best\navailable scientific evidence and the need\nfor the dissemination of these concepts\ninto clinical practice\nThere is wide variation in the practice of syncope evaluation, and\nwide variation in the adoption of recommendations from pub-\nlished guidelines. The absence of a systematic approach to TLOC\nincurs higher health and social care costs, unnecessary hospitaliza-\ntions and diagnostic procedures, prolongation of hospital stays,\nlower diagnostic rates, and higher rates of misdiagnoses and symp-\ntom recurrence.\nTherefore, there is a need for:\n1) Large clinical studies that assess the diagnostic yield and compliance of a\nguideline-based standardized systematic approach\nDespite the recommendation from the ESC Guidelines on syncope,\nsyncope units are not widely established in clinical practice. Barriers to\nestablishing a syncope unit include lack of resources, lack of trained\ndedicated staff, and complex presentations to multiple settings, necessi-\ntating involvement from multiple disciplines. The evidence for the use-\nfulness of syncope units is controversial.\nESC Guidelines\n1937\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/39/21/1883/4939241 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n.....................................................................................\nTherefore, there is a need for:\n2) Large clinical studies that test the superiority of management in a dedicated\nsyncope facility vs. conventional management\nDiagnosis: the need for new diagnostic\ntests and devices\nBP recording is crucial for the majority of clinical TLOC situations\nand will yield important information for the treatment of syncope.\nUnfortunately, current long-term BP (or surrogate) recording sys-\ntems are not optimal for diagnostic use in the syncope evaluation\nsetting.\nTherefore, there is a need for:\n3) Development and validation of new diagnostic multiparametric devices that\ncan record heart rhythm and BP (and possibly other physiological parameters\nsuch as cerebral saturation or EEG) at the time of a syncopal event.\nTreatment: lack of evidence of efficacy of\nmost available therapies\nOnly a few small RCTs have been conducted on treatment of syncope.\nIn addition, syncopal recurrences are unpredictable and often decrease\nspontaneously after medical assessment, even in the absence of a specific\ntherapy. The consequence of the spontaneous decrease is that any ther-\napy for syncope prevention appears to be more effective than it actually\nis, making the results of observational data on therapy questionable in\nthe absence of a control group. No therapy can be effective for all\npatients. Any therapy should be assessed in homogeneous subgroups.\nTherefore, there is strong urgent need for RCTs on the efficacy of:\n4) Pharmacological therapies targeted to specific subgroups of reflex syncope.\n5) Pacemaker therapy targeted to specific subgroups of cardioinhibitory reflex\nsyncope.\n6) Pharmacological therapies of OH-mediated syncope.\n7) ICD therapy targeted to specific subgroups of patients with unexplained syn-\ncope at risk of SCD.\nTreatment: the need for new therapies\nThere is a need to move towards personalized medicine. Improving\nour knowledge of the biochemical mechanisms underlying specific\nforms of reflex syncope will allow the development of new therapies\nin such specific settings. For example, a low adenosine phenotype\nand a low norepinephrine phenotype have been recently identified.\nTherefore, there is a need for:\n8) Randomized clinical trials on the efficacy of theophylline (and other xantine\nantagonists) for low adenosine syncope and norepinephrine transport inhibi-\ntors for low epinephrine syncope.\nSyncope is a transient phenomenon. The ideal therapy should be\none that is administered only when needed.\nTherefore, there is a need for:\n9) Randomized clinical trials of on-demand administration of specific therapy\nbased on specific sensors similar to adrenalin injectors in asthma or nasal\nspray for paroxysmal SVT.\nRecommendations\nClass\nLevel\nDiagnostic criteria with initial evaluation\nVVS is highly probable if
