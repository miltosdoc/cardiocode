The proposed staff requirements for specialist centres are\ndescribed in Table 5. The complexity of the heart defect should not be\nthe only criterion to assign patients to a certain level of care. Although\npatients with complex defects can easily be assigned to a high level of\ncare, even anatomically simple defects may require specialist care\nunder certain circumstances [e.g. atrial septal defect (ASD) with pul-\nmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)]. Therefore, it is recommended\nthat all ACHD patients are seen once in a specialist centre, allowing\nACHD specialists to determine the most appropriate level of care and\nfollow-up intervals for each individual patient.8 Networks of specialist\ncentres with general adult care should be established for each catch-\nment area. Indeed, with the growing population of adults with CHD,\nmore patients will first present to general cardiologists for acute condi-\ntions, such as arrhythmia, heart failure, or endocarditis. In such cases,\ngeneral cardiologists should not delay treatment in haemodynamically\nunstable patients but ought to liaise with the patient’s ACHD centre\nimmediately to discuss appropriate management strategies or transfer\nof the patient. Special attention is necessary for patients after Fontan\ncorrection presenting with arrhythmia, as even supraventricular\narrhythmias are not well tolerated. Detailed advice on emergency care\nfor ACHD patients will follow in a separate future position paper.\nTransfer of adolescents to ACHD care is vital as they approach\nadulthood without gaps in care, and should be preceded by a prepar-\natory transition phase with additional transition support that contin-\nues into early adulthood according to the needs of the patient.10\nTransition requires a special healthcare organization.10,11 It is recom-\nmended that specialist ACHD centres have teams including specialist\nnurses, psychologists, and social workers given that anxiety, depres-\nsion, or problems coping with the medical condition are well known\nconcerns in adult patients with CHD.12 They also play a critical role\nin the transition process by taking over the transitional care of\npatients after the transfer from paediatric cardiology. Aspects that\nhave to be addressed by allied health professionals include mental\nhealth, psychic well-being, and quality of life.12,13 During the ACHD\nN\nSurgery should be considered for ARCAPA in asymptomatic patients with ventricular dysfunction, or myocardial ischaemia attributable to\ncoronary anomaly.\nB) Anomalous aortic origin of a coronary artery (AAOCA)\nN\nSurgery is recommended for AAOCA in patients with typical angina symptoms who present with evidence of stress-induced myocardial\nischaemia in a matching territory or high-risk anatomy.\nN\nSurgery should be considered in asymptomatic patients with AAOCA (right or left) and evidence of myocardial ischaemia.\nN\nSurgery should be considered in asymptomatic patients with AAOLCA and no evidence of myocardial ischaemia but a high-risk anatomy.\nN\nSurgery may be considered for symptomatic patients with AAOCA even if they have neither evidence of myocardial ischaemia nor high-\nrisk anatomy.\nN\nSurgery may be considered for asymptomatic patients with AAOLCA without myocardial ischaemia and without high-risk anatomy when\nthey present at young age (<35 years).\nN\nSurgery is not recommended for AAORCA in asymptomatic patients without myocardial ischaemia and without high-risk anatomy.\nNew concepts\nNaming (ACHD).\nDisease complexity classiﬁcation.\nStafﬁng requirements for an ACHD expert centre.\nEmerging role of biomarkers in follow-up of ACHD.\nDetailed and speciﬁc recommendations on arrhythmia management.\nMore speciﬁc and adjusted recommendations for PAH treatment.\nRecommendations on the use of anticoagulants.\nConsideration of ageing and advance care planning.\nCategories of high-risk pregnancies in accordance with the pregnancy guidelines.\nExpand Marfan syndrome section to aortopathies (and include HTAD, Turner syndrome, and bicuspid aortic disease).\nEmerging role of catheter intervention in ACHD.\n6MWT = 6-minute walk test; AAOCA = anomalous aortic origin of a coronary artery; AAOLCA = anomalous aortic origin of the left coronary artery; ACAPA = anomalous\ncoronary artery from the pulmonary artery; ACHD = adult congenital heart disease; AF = atrial ﬁbrillation; ALCAPA = anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary\nartery; ARCAPA = anomalous right coronary artery from the pulmonary artery; AS = aortic stenosis; ASD = atrial septal defect; AV = atrioventricular; AVSD = atrioventricular\nseptal defect; BNP = B-type natriuretic peptide; ccTGA = congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries; CHD = congenital heart disease; CMR = cardiovascular\nmagnetic resonance; EF = ejection fraction; HTAD = heritable thoracic aortic disease; IART = intraatrial reentrant tachycardia; ICD = implantable cardioverter deﬁbrillator;\nL\u0002R = left-to-right; LV = left ventricle/ventricular; LVEF = left ventricular ejection fraction; LVESD = left ventricular end systolic diameter; LVOT = left ventricular outﬂow\ntract; LVOTO = left ventricular outﬂow tract obstruction; N = new recommendation; PAH = pulmonary arterial hypertension; PAH-CHD = pulmonary arterial hypertension\nassociated with congenital heart disease; PAP = pulmonary artery pressure; PDA = patent ductus arteriosus; PFO = patent foramen ovale; PH = pulmonary hypertension; PR =\npulmonary regurgitation; PVR = pulmonary vascular resistance; Qp:Qs = pulmonary to systemic ﬂow ratio; R = revised recommendation; RA = right atrium/atrial; R\u0002L = right-\nto-left; RV = right ventricle/ventricular; RVEDVi = right ventricular end diastolic volume indexed; RVESVi = right ventricular end systolic volume indexed; RVOT = right ventric-\nular outﬂow tract; RVOTO = right ventricular outﬂow tract obstruction; RVSP = right ventricular systolic pressure; SVT = supraventricular tachycardia; TGA = transposition of\nthe great arteries; TGFBR = transforming growth factor beta receptor; TOF = tetralogy of Fallot; TPVI = transcatheter pulmonary valve implantation; TR = tricuspid regurgita-\ntion; TV = tricuspid valve; UVH = univentricular heart; VSD = ventricular septal defect; VT = ventricular tachycardia; WU = Wood units.\n574\nESC Guidelines\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/6/563/5898606 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n....................................\ncare journey, advance care planning choices and strategies relating to\nend of life also require expert support.\n3.3 Diagnostic work-up\nBesides a thorough clinical evaluation, the medical history, including\ndetailed information about palliative or reparative surgery and\ncatheter-based interventions, is of critical importance in the work-up\nof ACHD patients.

For left ventricular (LV) systolic\nfunction,\n3D\nechocardiography,\ntissue\nDoppler\nimaging,\nand\ntwo-dimensional deformation imaging have proved to be robust\ntools and deserve to be integrated into clinical practice. Even\naccounting for newer techniques, echocardiography retains a key\nrole in longitudinal follow-up assessment of systolic function of a right\nor single ventricle, although for more accurate measurements addi-\ntional imaging is often needed in the form of CMR.\n3.3.2 Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging\nCMR has become an essential facility in the specialist unit. It enables 3D\nanatomical reconstruction, which is not restricted by body size or\nacoustic windows, and has rapidly improving spatial and temporal reso-\nlution.18 CMR requires a regular heart rhythm for optimal image quality,\nhowever, diagnostic CMR studies are often achievable even in patients\nwith irregular heart rhythms [frequent ectopy or atrial fibrillation (AF)]\nand metallic artefacts. CMR is the gold-standard imaging method for\nquantification of volumes. It may be an alternative when echocardiogra-\nphy cannot be obtained with sufficient quality, or used as a second\nmethod when echocardiography measurements are borderline or\nambiguous. Furthermore, the lack of radiation makes it a useful tool\nwhen serial evaluations are needed (e.g. for monitoring aortic dimen-\nsions). CMR allows calculation of systemic and pulmonary blood flow in\npatients with multiple sources of blood supply and, in combination with\ninvasive catheterization, of pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). Tissue\ncharacterisation for myocardial fibrosis is a unique capability of CMR.\nLate gadolinium enhancement CMR for focal fibrosis and interstitial fib-\nrosis T1 mapping imaging are increasingly being applied in ACHD for\ntheir potential diagnostic and prognostic value. However, large CHD\nlesion-specific studies to determine if they predict survival are ongoing.\nTo mitigate the low risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, gadoli-\nnium contrast should be avoided in patients with a low glomerular fil-\ntration rate (<30 mL/min/1.73 m2). It is therefore recommended that\ncreatinine levels are checked prior to CMR. Even though clinical\nrepercussions have not yet been seen, long-term brain deposits of\ngadolinium \u0002 regardless of renal function \u0002 raised concerns about\ncumulative lifetime doses in CHD patients who undergo serial CMR\nfrom a young age. It is preferred, therefore, that gadolinium is selec-\ntively administered in specialist centres using a macrocyclic, rather\nthan linear chelated, gadolinium contrast, which presents a decreased\nrisk at the lowest dose to achieve image enhancement.19\nAdults with CHD with conventional pacemakers (PM) and defibril-\nlators (ICD) can undergo CMR within guidelines where local support\nis available.20\n3D CMR imaging can be integrated into electrophysiology (EP)\nprocedures to inform and guide them. 3D CCT and CMR recon-\nstructions can also be used for virtual reality rehearsal of interven-\ntions or planning from patient-specific 3D prints.\nIndications for CMR are summarized in Table 6.\n3.3.3 Cardiovascular computed tomography\nCCT has high spatial resolution and rapid acquisition time; it is partic-\nularly relevant for imaging the great vessels, coronary arteries, and\ncollateral arteries, and for parenchymal lung disease (Table 6). In\nmany institutions, CCT is the preferred imaging modality in planning\nfor transcatheter valve implantation. Ventricular size and function can\nbe assessed, with inferior temporal resolution compared with CMR,\ntypically with an increased radiation dose, and is therefore not used\nserially for this indication. Recent rapid developments have substan-\ntially reduced the amount of radiation exposure, achieving <5 mSv\nfor a combined CCT coronary, pulmonary, and aortic angiogram. For\nACHD patients, this has made CCT more attractive for specific indi-\ncations such as assessment, in particular for coronary artery pathol-\nogy, and detailed assessment of collaterals.21\nCCT is particularly useful in emergency settings including dissec-\ntion, pulmonary embolism, and paravalvular abscess in the setting of\nendocarditis, where it may have advantages over echocardiography\nand CMR due to being less susceptible to prosthetic valve artefact.\nIn patients with prosthetic valves (in situ >3 months), fluorine-18-\nfluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomog-\nraphy is useful for early diagnosis of inflammation and infection at the\nsite of the valve, and also for identifying infection at secondary sites.22\n3.3.4 Cardiopulmonary exercise testing\nFormal exercise testing has an important role in the CHD population,\nin which quality of life and functional capacity are key measures of the\nsuccess of intervention. CPET, including assessment of objective\nexercise capacity (peak oxygen consumption), ventilatory efficiency\n[ventilation to carbon dioxide output (VE/VCO2) slope], chrono-\ntropic and blood pressure response, as well as exercise-induced\narrhythmia and desaturation, gives a broader evaluation of functional\ncapacity and physical fitness, and has endpoints which correlate well\nwith morbidity and mortality in ACHD patients.23 Serial exercise\ntesting should therefore be a part of long-term follow-up protocols.\nIt plays an important role in the timing of interventions and reinter-\nventions. CPET is also a useful tool for recommending the intensity\nof physical activity based on an individualized exercise prescription.24\nThe 6-minute walk test (6MWT) is another simple test for quantifica-\ntion of exercise capacity; it relates to outcome in patients with PAH.\n3.3.5\nCardiac catheterization\nCardiac catheterization is mainly reserved for resolution of specific\nanatomical\nand\nphysiological\nquestions,\nor\nfor\nintervention.\nIndications include assessment of PVR, ventricular diastolic function\n(including constrictive and restrictive physiology), pressure gradients,\nshunt quantification, coronary angiography, and evaluation of extrac-\nardiac vessels such as aortic pulmonary collateral arteries when non-\ninvasive evaluation leaves uncertainty.\nIn shunt lesions with Doppler echocardiographic signs of PH, cath-\neterization \u0002 including testing of vasoreactivity \u0002 remains essential\nin the decision on shunt closure. Inhaled nitric oxide is the most\nwidely used agent for this purpose. Estimation of PVR in shunt lesions\nrequires accurate calculation of pulmonary flow using the Fick princi-\nple. This method with measured oxygen consumption allows the\nmost accurate cardiac output quantification.\nBefore surgery, coronary artery imaging should be performed (by\nCCT or invasive coronary angiography) in men >40 years of age,\npostmenopausal women, and patients with signs of, or one or more\nrisk factors for, coronary artery disease (CAD).25\n3.3.6\nBiomarkers\nDifferent classes of biomarkers have been reported to be associated\nwith\nadverse\nevents\nin\nthe\nCHD\npopulation,\nincluding\n578\nESC Guidelines\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/6/563/5898606 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n.............................................................................................................................................................................\nneurohormones and markers of myocardial injury (high-sensitivity\ntroponins) or inflammation (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein).\nAmong the neurohormones, natriuretic peptides [B-type natriuretic\npeptide (BNP) and N-terminal-pro-BNP (NT-pro-BNP)] are best\nstudied in ACHD patients. They carry important prognostic informa-\ntion, but are less useful to diagnose heart failure across different car-\ndiac lesions due to a cut-off variability depending on the underlying\ndefect and type of repair.26 They are most useful in patients with\nbiventricular circulation and least useful in patients with a Fontan cir-\nculation.27 Serial testing of natriuretic peptides plays a role in identify-\ning patients at risk for adverse events. Of note, natriuretic peptides\nmay be increased in cyanotic heart disease simply due to hypoxia-\ninduced peptide secretion.28\n3.4 Therapeutic considerations\n3.4.1\nHeart failure\nThe development of heart failure is a common problem affecting\n20\u000250% of the ACHD population, and is a main cause of death.29 The\nincidence is increasing and is probably underestimated. Since latent\nsigns and symptoms of heart failure might occur frequently, patients at\nhigh risk of developing heart failure require systematic follow-up and\ndiagnostic screening.30 Any haemodynamic abnormalities, including\narrhythmias, potentially causing heart failure that can be addressed by\nintervention or surgery must be excluded and, if possible, treated first.\nIn the absence of specific guidelines, ACHD practitioners follow the\ncurrent guidelines for medical treatment for both heart failure and\ncommon heart failure-related comorbidities, such as diabetes mellitus,\nAF, central sleep apnoea, iron deficiency, and cachexia.31 However, as\nthe pathophysiology of cardiorespiratory dysfunction is often different\nfrom the failing circulation in patients with non-congenital (acquired)\nheart disease, extrapolation of results from published heart failure stud-\nies to ACHD patients are inappropriate, particularly in patients with a\nsystemic right ventricle (RV), a failing subpulmonary ventricle, or in\npatients with a single ventricle physiology. The pathophysiology of\nACHD heart failure with systolic ventricular dysfunction includes a\nbroad spectrum of causes. Both systemic and subpulmonary ventricles,\nwhether morphological left or right, single ventricles included, might be\nchronically overloaded by pressure and/or volume, which leads to pro-\ngressive ventricular dysfunction. Altered myocardial architecture (non-\ncompaction) and ventricular interdependence can compromise systolic\nventricular function. Myocardial injury (limited myocardial protection\nduring bypass, after ventriculotomy, and after chronic hypoxia) may\noccur in CHD patients. Finally, ischaemic heart disease \u0002 mainly\nrelated to ageing or congenital coronary anomalies \u0002 and persistent\ntachyarrhythmia might be responsible for impaired systemic and sub-\npulmonary ventricular function.30 The few available data on heart fail-\nure treatments, specifically in ACHD patients, are often not conclusive\nand derived from small patient cohorts. As a consequence, ACHD-\nspecific recommendations are mostly based on clinical experience or\nposition statements.30 In a biventricular circulation, patients with an\nimpaired systemic LV are generally treated with conventional heart fail-\nure therapy; this is also applied in symptomatic patients with a failing\nsystemic RV. Diuretics mainly control symptoms; whether the long-\nterm use of inhibitors of the renin\u0002angiotensin aldosterone system or\nbeta blockers influences clinical outcome remains unknown. Also, no\nlong-term clinical benefit of conventional heart failure treatment has\nbeen shown in a failing subpulmonary ventricle, although diuretics\nmight alleviate symptoms. Treatment of symptomatic patients with a\nfailing single ventricle in a Fontan circulation, or in the case of a persis-\ntent right-to-left (R\u0002L) shunt, should always be carefully initiated, tak-\ning the labile balance of ventricular preload and systemic afterload into\naccount. In ACHD patients with heart failure, there are currently only\na few small studies looking at the new drug sacubitril/valsartan, which\nwas found to decrease morbidity and mortality and implemented in\nthe therapy of chronic heart failure in recent ESC Guidelines31, how-\never, no recommendation can be made at this moment. Heart failure\nwith preserved EF is also not uncommon in ACHD patients.\nTherapeutic recommendations should follow the general heart failure\nguidelines. On top of medical treatment, cardiac resynchronization\ntherapy (CRT) has gained increasing interest for use in ACHD patients\nwith congestive heart failure, despite little evidence on indications and\noutcomes. Efficacy of CRT in CHD may vary with the underlying struc-\ntural and functional substrate, such as anatomy of the systemic ventricle\n(left, right, or functionally single), presence and degree of structural sys-\ntemic atrioventricular (AV) valve regurgitation, primary myocardial dis-\nease or scarring, and type of electrical conduction delay.32\nIt is expected that the incidence of acute heart failure in ACHD\npatients will also increase over time due to increasing age and more\ncomplex diseases. The knowledge of correct use of inotropes, the\navailability of extra-corporal membrane oxygenation, and advanced\nbridging techniques are the minimum requirements to adequately\nsupport ACHD patients with acute heart failure; transfer to an\nexpert centre is recommended.33\nHeart transplantation may also be considered as a therapeutic option\nfor end-stage heart failure. Outcome after transplant surgery is continu-\nously improving, particularly in CHD patients, but perioperative mortal-\nity still remains higher than in other underlying diseases. This is mainly\nrelated to previous cardiac surgery, complex anatomy and pathophysiol-\nogy, and comorbidities (multisystem disorder). The increased use of ven-\ntricular assist devices can bridge patients to transplantation; in selected\npatients, it may be an option as destination therapy. Some patients may\nhave extreme complex anatomy or high levels of antibodies against the\nhuman leucocyte antigens and are not eligible for transplantation.\nIn some patients, multiorgan transplantation is required. Heart-\nlung transplantation is applied in CHD patients with irreversible PAH\nsuch as Eisenmenger syndrome, however, the lack of donor organs is\na major limitation.\nSimultaneous heart-liver transplantation is rarely done in liver fail-\nure after Fontan palliation or in patients with long-standing hepatic\npressure load due to right heart failure [e.g. unrecognized Ebstein’s\nmalformation of the tricuspid valve (TV)]; experience of this kind of\nsurgery is limited.\nIn all cases, timely evaluation for transplantation by ACHD heart\nfailure specialists in a transplant centre with ACHD expertise is rec-\nommended. Advance care planning, eventually including palliative\ncare, should be offered to all advanced heart failure patients.\n3.4.2\nArrhythmias and sudden cardiac death\n3.4.2.1 Arrhythmia substrates\nThe entire spectrum of arrhythmias may be encountered in ACHD\npatients.

Arrhythmias causing hae-\nmodynamic instability require immediate termination irrespective of\nduration/anticoagulation\nfollowing\ncurrent\nrecommendations.32\nPost-conversion, sinus arrest/bradycardia may occur and availability\nof back-up pacing needs to be considered in patients at risk for sinus\nnode dysfunction (SND) (Table 7). If IART/AF is tolerated and lasting\n>_48 h, cardiac thrombus needs to be ruled out (TOE) and/or appro-\npriate anticoagulation (>3 weeks) and pharmacological rate control\nneeds to be initiated before cardioversion using a beta blocker or cal-\ncium channel blocker (in patients with normal systemic ventricular\nfunction and absent preexcitation).32,37,38 Maintenance of sinus\nrhythm is the aim in all CHD patients.32,37 Catheter ablation is rec-\nommended as first-line therapy and preferred over long-term phar-\nmacological\ntreatment,\nin\ncase\nof\namenable,\ncircumscribed\nsubstrates, as antiarrhythmic drugs are often associated with negative\ninotropic and/or dromotropic effects.32 Antiarrhythmic drugs such as\nclass IC drugs may slow the rate of IART without blocking AV con-\nduction allowing 1:1 conduction with worsening haemodynamics.32\nAmiodarone may be considered for AT/AF recurrence prevention in\npatients with CHD and systemic ventricular dysfunction, hypertro-\nphy of systemic ventricle, or CAD, in whom catheter ablation fails or\nis otherwise no option. Side effects of amiodarone are frequent and it\nshould be used with caution in cyanotic CHD, low body weight, hep-\natic, thyroid, or pulmonary disease, or prolonged QT interval. Long-\nterm amiodarone therapy is not advised in young CHD patients.32\nFor optimal chronic arrhythmia management, referral to a centre\nwith a multidisciplinary team and expertise in CHD-related arrhyth-\nmias is mandatory.32,37 For more specifications on anticoagulation\nsee section 3.4.7.\n3.4.2.3 Sinus node dysfunction, atrioventricular block, and infra-hisian\nconduction delay\nPeriodic Holter for patients at risk for SND and AV block should be\nconsidered in asymptomatic patients. Chronic SND/bradycardia with\nineffective atrial haemodynamics may affect atrial remodelling and\nfacilitate IART. Patients with post-operative AV block are considered\nat increased risk for SCD. Accordingly, broader indications for pace-\nmaker implantation compared with patients with structurally normal\nhearts have been suggested.20,32\nIn ACHD patients with a biventricular circulation and a systemic\nLV, indications for CRT follow standard criteria. Of note, conven-\ntional ventricular pacing rather than bundle branch block is the major\ncause of systemic ventricular dysfunction. Accordingly, CRT is rec-\nommended in ACHD with a systemic EF <_35% and intrinsic narrow\nQRS, and an anticipated requirement for significant pacing and new\ndevice placement. Alternatively, his bundle pacing could be consid-\nered. Efficacy of CRT in ACHD may vary across defects and may\ndepend on the individual anatomy and causes of dyssynchrony (e.g.\nsystemic RV/single ventricle, AV valve regurgitation, scarring). In gen-\neral, QRS duration alone may not be a sufficient predictor and\nfollow-up data are limited. In addition, thoracotomy or hybrid lead\nimplantation is often required and data on longevity of CRT are\nlacking.32\n3.4.2.4 Sudden cardiac death and risk stratification\nSCD related to ventricular arrhythmia is of concern (7\u000226% of all\ndeaths in adults).29,39,40 Although the incidence in the CHD popula-\ntion at large is relatively low (<0.1% per year), some defects place\npatients at higher risk, with occasional disease-specific substrates and\nrisk factors (Table 7). Identifying patients at risk for SCD remains a\nchallenge.\nICD implantation for secondary prevention of SCD and for pri-\nmary prevention in patients with biventricular physiology and a sys-\ntemic LV follows standard criteria.37,41 Antiarrhythmic drugs may be\nused as an adjunct to an ICD in order to reduce the ventricular\narrhythmia burden.32 The benefit of ICD therapy in primary preven-\ntion for single or systemic RVs is less well established.\nAccordingly, with the exception of tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), spe-\ncific guidelines regarding ICD implantation for primary prevention in\nCHD remain elusive.32,37 Transvenous ICD systems have been used,\nbut in patients with limited venous access to the ventricle or intracar-\ndiac shunt, the subcutaneous ICD may be an alternative. However,\nnot all patients are eligible due to the risk of inappropriate sensing\nand lack of antitachycardia and antibradycardia pacing.\nThe usefulness of programmed electrical stimulation (PES) in\nasymptomatic patients with CHD is unclear. It seems reasonable in\npatients with ventricular incisions and/or a substrate for ventricular\nreentry typically, but not exclusively, encountered in repaired TOF\n(rTOF). It is important to recognize other causes of SCD due to bra-\ndycardia/total AV block and bradycardia-induced ventricular arrhyth-\nmia with or without long QT, and IART/AF with rapid conduction.\nRecommendations for treatment of arrhythmias in\nadult congenital heart disease\nRecommendations\nClassa\nLevelb\nIn patients with moderate and severe CHD com-\nplexity (Table 4) and documented arrhythmias,\nreferral to a centre with a multidisciplinary team\nand expertise in ACHD patients and ACHD-\nrelated arrhythmia is indicated.\nI\nC\nIn CHD patients with documented arrhythmias\nor at high risk for post-procedural arrhythmias\n(e.g. ASD closure at older age) considered for\npercutaneous or surgical (re)interventions,\nreferral to a centre with a multidisciplinary team\nwith expertise in these interventions and in inva-\nsive treatment of arrhythmias is indicated.\nI\nC\nIn mild CHD, catheter ablation is recommended\nover long-term medical therapy for sympto-\nmatic, sustained recurrent SVT (AVNRT, AVRT,\nAT, and IART), or if SVT is potentially related to\nSCD (Table 7).\nI\nC\nIn moderate and severe CHD, catheter ablation\nshould be considered for symptomatic, sustained\nrecurrent SVT (AVNRT, AVRT, AT, and IART),\nor if SVT is potentially related to SCD (Table 7),\nprovided that the procedure is performed in\nexperienced centres.\nIIa\nC\nContinued\nESC Guidelines\n581\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/6/563/5898606 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n...............................................................................................\n3.4.3\nPulmonary hypertension\n3.4.3.1 Introduction and classification\nPH is an important prognostic factor in patients with CHD,42 requir-\ning particular attention in pregnancy43 or prior to reparative cardiac\nor other major surgery. Until recently, PH was defined by an increase\nin invasively measured mean PAP >_25 mmHg at rest.44 While this has\nnow been reduced to >20 mmHg,45 classification as pre-capillary PH\n\u0002 also called PAH \u0002 additionally requires an increase in PVR >_3\nWood units (WU) (Table 8).45 This increase in resistance in this\ngroup is due to an obstructive pulmonary vasculopathy which is\ndriven by genetic background, modifier genes, vascular shear stress,\nand environmental triggers.44 It is important to separate PAH associ-\nated with CHD (PAH-CHD, in group 1 of the PH classification44)\nfrom conditions with an LV filling pressure >15 mmHg (post-capillary\nPH due to passive transmission of LV filling pressures in groups 2 and\n5 of the PH classification),44 because of the futility of PAH-targeted\ntreatments in post-capillary PH. Clinical subtypes of PAH-CHD are\nPAH with congenital systemic-pulmonary shunts, Eisenmenger syn-\ndrome, repaired defects, and PAH that appears coincidental with\nCHD, frequently with small defects. Fontan circulation is another\ncondition with pulmonary vascular disease (PVD) and sometimes ele-\nvated PVR.

In this definition, mean\nPAP threshold is >20 instead of >_25 mmHg in the presence of a PVR\n>_3 WU to define pre-capillary PH.45\n3.4.3.2.1 Diagnostic work-up of pulmonary hypertension in adult congenital\nheart disease.\nThe diagnostic work-up includes medical history, physical examination,\nlung function tests, arterial blood gas analysis, imaging (especially echo-\ncardiography), and laboratory testing (including total blood cell counts,\nserum iron levels, haematocrit, infectious diseases, and NT-pro-BNP\nmeasurements). In general, right heart catheterization with compartmen-\ntal oximetry is required for major decisions such as start and follow-up\nof vasodilator therapy, pregnancy, or surgery. The threshold for invasive\nassessment is, however, higher in patients with Eisenmenger syndrome.\nInvasive haemodynamic assessment is usually not required for guiding\ntherapeutic interventions over time. Because higher haematocrit levels\nlead to higher PVR, this may have to be taken into account.49\n3.4.3.2.2\nRisk assessment.\nOutcomes of PAH-CHD patients have improved with the availability\nof new PAH therapies, advances in surgical and perioperative man-\nagement, and use of a team-based, multidisciplinary approach.44,50,51\nIn recent series, outcomes of PAH-CHD patients appear to be better\nthan in idiopathic PAH,48 but depend on the PH subset. Outcomes of\nPAH associated with small defects resemble the dismal outcomes of\nidiopathic PAH, presumably because these conditions are based on a\nsimilar vascular proliferative disorder. PAH after defect repair carries\neven worse prognosis.48\n3.4.3.3 Therapeutic management of pulmonary hypertension in adult\ncongenital heart disease\n3.4.3.3.1 Expert centres.\nSuccessful management of an ACHD patient with PH requires a mul-\ntidisciplinary management team comprising experts in imaging, cardi-\nology,\nrespiratory\nmedicine,\nhaematology,\ninfectious\ndiseases,\nobstetrics, anaesthesiology, neonatology, PH, thoracic and cardiovas-\ncular surgery, nursing, and medical genetics.\n3.4.3.3.2\nGeneral measures.\nThe\nmain\ngeneral\nmeasures\nare\nsocial\nand\npsychological\nsupport, vaccination, and avoidance of excessive physical stress.\nFollow-up visits are planned individually. Pregnancy must be avoided\nin all cases of pre-capillary PH.

The threshold PVR permitting reparative surgical clo-\nsure of a left-to-right (L\u0002R) shunt without right heart failure differs for\nthe different shunt lesions (see sections 4.1\u00024.4). However, the decision\nto close a shunt is made using all the available information and is not\nsolely dependent on the haemodynamics obtained at cardiac catheter-\nization;53,54 the decision should only be taken in expert centres.\nThere is no prospective evidence that a treat-and-repair approach\nin patients with PAH-CHD confers long-term benefits.44,55 No pro-\nspective data are available on the usefulness of vasoreactivity testing,\nclosure test, or lung biopsy for assessment of operability.53,54,56\u000260\n3.4.3.3.5\nPulmonary arterial hypertension-directed medical therapy.\nAdvanced therapies benefit patients with Eisenmenger syndrome,51\nand likely also other PAH-CHD.61,62 According to the 2015 ESC/ERS\nGuidelines on PH,44pre-capillary PH (PAH), including Eisenmenger\nsyndrome, is a moderate- to high-risk condition and requires a proac-\ntive approach using initial63 or sequential combination treatment,64,65\nincluding parenteral prostacyclins.44 Parenteral prostaglandins work\nbest when started early.66 The presence of a central intravenous\ncatheter for parenteral therapy, however, increases the risk of para-\ndoxical embolism and infection in Eisenmenger patients and those\nwith R\u0002L shunt lesions. In this setting, subcutaneous or inhaled forms\nof administration are therefore generally preferred.\nExclusions to this rule are patients with closed or coincidental\ndefects meeting strict criteria for vasodilator responsiveness (mainly\na decrease of mean PAP >10 mmHg and below 40 mmHg acutely\nunder nitric oxide inhalation) who may be treated with calcium chan-\nnel blocker therapy only. However, such patients are extremely rare\namong adults with PAH-CHD. General vasoreactivity testing is not\nrecommended in PAH-CHD.44\nLong-term home oxygen therapy may improve symptoms but has\nnot been shown to augment survival in Eisenmenger patients. The\nuse of supplemental oxygen should be restricted to those cases in\nwhich it produces a documented, consistent, and significant increase\nin arterial oxygen saturation and improves symptoms.\nSecondary erythrocytosis is beneficial for adequate oxygen trans-\nport and delivery, and routine phlebotomy should be avoided; for\nmore details see section 3.4.8.\nIn Eisenmenger patients, the endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA)\nbosentan has been shown to improve 6MWT and decrease PVR after\n16 weeks of treatment in World Health Organization (WHO) func-\ntional class III patients.67 Although a beneficial effect of bosentan has\nbeen shown on exercise capacity and quality of life in this group of\npatients, an effect on mortality is less well documented. Long-term fol-\nlow-up showed sustained improvement in symptoms. Experiences\nwith other ERAs and the phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5) inhibitors,\nsildenafil and tadalafil, show favourable functional and haemodynamic\nresults in patients with PAH-CHD and Eisenmenger syndrome, with\nless robust evidence. Experience is limited for latest-generation PAH\ndrugs such as macitentan, selexipag, or riociguat in the setting of\nCHD.66 While patients with simple repaired lesions have been\nincluded in the landmark studies for these substances, and are likely to\nbenefit similarly to idiopathic PAH patients, data are currently limited\nfor Eisenmenger patients. A recent randomized controlled trial investi-\ngating efficacy of macitentan to improve 6MWT in Eisenmenger syn-\ndrome was neutral.68 Most centres follow a sequential symptom-\norientated treatment strategy in Eisenmenger syndrome, generally\nstarting with an oral ERA or PDE-5 inhibitor and escalating therapy if\nsymptoms persist or in the case of clinical deterioration. Should an\nadequate improvement in symptoms not be achieved with oral ther-\napy, parenteral options should be considered proactively.\nThe effect of PAH therapy in patients with segmental PAH remains\na matter of debate. While some series reported promising results,\nthere have been cases where therapies were not tolerated.46\nHeart-lung or lung transplantation with heart surgery is an option\nin special cases not responsive to medical treatment but is limited by\nsurgical complexity and organ availability.\n3.4.4\nSurgical treatment\nCardiac surgery in ACHD patients deserves special attention. Even\nsmall operations can carry a high risk due to the dysregulation of the\ndelicate balance in which ACHD patients often thrive. This risk can-\nnot be calculated using conventional surgical risk scores. The adult\ncongenital heart surgery score was derived from the Society of\nRecommendations for treatment of pulmonary arterial\nhypertension associated with congenital heart disease\nRecommendations\nClassa\nLevelb\nIt is recommended that patients with CHD and\nconﬁrmed pre-capillary PHc are counselled\nagainst pregnancy.\nI\nC\nRisk assessment is recommended in all patients\nwith PAH-CHD.d\nI\nC\nIn low- and intermediate-risk patients with\nrepaired simple lesions and pre-capillary PH,\ninitial oral combination therapy or sequential\ncombination therapy is recommended and high-\nrisk patients should be treated with initial com-\nbination therapy including parenteral prosta-\nnoids.e 63\u000265\nI\nA\nIn Eisenmenger patients with reduced exercise\ncapacity (6MWT distance <450 m), a treatment\nstrategy with initial endothelin receptor antago-\nnist monotherapy should be considered fol-\nlowed by combination therapy if patients fail to\nimprove.67\u000269\nIIa\nB\n6MWT = 6-minute walk test; CHD = congenital heart disease; PAH-CHD = pul-\nmonary arterial hypertension associated with congenital heart disease; PH = pul-\nmonary hypertension.\naClass of recommendation.\nbLevel of evidence.\ncThe risk of pregnancy in patients with pre-capillary PH is very high.

When\nACHD patients are operated on by a congenital cardiac surgeon,\noutcome is proven to be superior.73 Therefore, the strict recom-\nmendation is that all ACHD patients are operated on by a congeni-\ntal cardiac surgeon in a multidisciplinary environment with\nexpertise in ACHD. This holds true for all ACHD cardiac surgery\nin the present recommendations except for surgery of uncompli-\ncated bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), heritable thoracic aortic disease\n(HTAD) such as Marfan syndrome, and secundum-type ASD with-\nout anomalous pulmonary venous connection and/or absence of\nPVD. The multidisciplinary expert environment also favours the\ngrowing interest in, and need for, hybrid procedures, where (con-\ngenital) cardiac surgeons, vascular surgeons, interventional congen-\nital cardiologists, and electrophysiologists collaborate in technically\nchallenging procedures.\n3.4.5\nCatheter intervention\nCatheter-based interventions, either as stand-alone or hybrid proce-\ndures, are an appealing alternative to conventional open-heart sur-\ngery, obviating the need for redo sternotomy/thoracotomy and\ncardiopulmonary bypass. The most frequent percutaneous interven-\ntions are closure of shunt lesions (in particular secundum-type ASD,\nrarely VSD, and persistent arterial duct), fistula, or unusual collaterals;\nballoon dilatation of the pulmonary valve and valved grafts; balloon\ndilatation and/or stenting of narrowed great vessels [e.g. (re-coarcta-\ntion of the aorta (CoA) and pulmonary arterial stenosis]; and trans-\ncatheter pulmonary valve implantation (TPVI). ACHD diagnosis and,\nin particular, interventional care should be delivered by people who\nare trained as CHD caregivers and are part of an ACHD care centre,\nwhere individual procedures are reviewed and discussed within a\nmultidisciplinary team.74 It is of particular importance that a pro-\ngramme performing transcatheter interventions in ACHD patients\nshould be co-located with appropriate congenital cardiac services for\nthe management of procedural complications. In many programmes,\nexperienced paediatric interventional cardiologists form an impor-\ntant component of ACHD intervention services, but in others (e.g.\nthose based in a separate paediatric hospital), paediatric intervention-\nalists may be uncomfortable with the interventional management of\nadults with congenital cardiac problems. Therefore, full collaboration\nbetween\nadult\nand\npaediatric\ncardiology\nis\nrecommended.\nConcentration of ACHD catheterization in a limited number of des-\nignated centres allows quality assurance as well as co-location of key\ncardiovascular services.74 Minimum annual numbers of interventions\nper centre have been proposed in a recent recommendation\npaper.74\n3.4.6\nInfective endocarditis\nThe risk of infective endocarditis (IE) in ACHD patients is higher than\nin the general population, with marked variation between lesions.\nThe 2015 ESC Guidelines on IE maintain the restriction of antibiotic\nprophylaxis to patients at high risk of IE undergoing at-risk dental pro-\ncedures.22 High-risk conditions are prosthetic valves, including trans-\ncatheter valves, valve repair using a prosthetic ring, previous IE, any\ncyanotic CHD, and any CHD repaired with prosthetic material up to\n6 months after the procedure or lifelong if residual shunt or valvular\nregurgitation remains.\nNon-specific hygiene measures should be applied in all ACHD\npatients: good oral and cutaneous hygiene, and aseptic measures dur-\ning healthcare and any invasive procedure. Piercings and tattoos are\ndiscouraged and otherwise should be performed in optimal hygienic\nconditions.\nAll patients need to be educated about symptoms of IE and appro-\npriate behaviour (seeking medical advice, importance of blood cul-\ntures before starting antibiotic treatment) at occurrence of such\nsymptoms.\nRecent studies confirmed the relatively high risk of IE in patients\nafter valve surgery, particularly previous IE and bovine jugular vein\nconduits.75\u000278 Specific awareness is needed after TPVI using a\nMelody valve prosthesis.75\n3.4.7\nAntithrombotic treatment\nPatients with ACHD are at increased risk of thromboembolic events,\nbut evidence on prevention is limited. In patients with IART or AF,\nthe CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED scores have proven beneficial in\nadult patients with acquired heart disease.38 However, as their valid-\nity in the CHD population is uncertain, the scores should only be\nused in combination with individually assessed risks. Traditionally,\nVKAs are used for thromboembolic prevention, but in general cardi-\nology, NOACs are currently recommended in preference to VKA.\nAlso, in the CHD population, NOACs seem similarly safe and effec-\ntive, in the absence of mechanical valves or severe mitral valve steno-\nsis.79,80 Anticoagulation therapy is recommended in paroxysmal and\npersistent AF/IART in patients with moderate or severe CHD, but an\nindividualized approach remains necessary. In patients with mild\nCHD, the CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED scores38 should be used\nas per general recommendations.81 Whether all Fontan patients ben-\nefit from anticoagulation is unclear at the moment. Bleeding risk\nshould also be considered and weighed against thrombogenic risk,\nespecially in cyanotic patients. For secondary prevention, anticoagula-\ntion is recommended in patients with a thromboembolic event or\nincidental intracardiac or intravascular thrombus (see also 2017 ESC/\nEACTS Guidelines on valvular heart disease and 2018 ESC\nGuidelines on pregnancy).\n3.4.8\nManagement of cyanotic patients\nCyanosis is caused by R\u0002L shunt due to an anatomical communica-\ntion between the systemic and pulmonary circulation at the atrial,\nventricular, or arterial level. Cyanotic heart disease comprises a het-\nerogeneous group of lesions with different underlying anatomy and\npathophysiology: normal or restricted pulmonary blood flow in the\npresence of an obstruction across the pulmonary outflow tract or\nincreased pulmonary blood flow in the absence of such an obstruc-\ntion which, in some defects, may result in development of PAH and\nESC Guidelines\n585\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/6/563/5898606 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n.............................................................................................................................................................................\neventually Eisenmenger syndrome (see sections 3.4.3 and 4.15).\nThey may present with or without prior palliative intervention.\nCyanotic patients are complex and must be followed by an ACHD\nspecialist.\n3.4.8.1 Adaptive mechanisms\nCyanosis induces adaptive mechanisms to improve oxygen transport\nand delivery to the tissue: secondary erythrocytosis, rightward shift\nof the oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve, and increase in cardiac\noutput.82,83 Erythrocytosis secondary to erythropoietin stimulus is\nthe physiological response to chronic hypoxaemia. Compensated\nerythrocytosis reflects an equilibrium and decompensated erythrocy-\ntosis indicates failure of an equilibrium (excessive red blood cell/hae-\nmoglobin increase and unstable, rising haematocrit with major\nhyperviscosity symptoms).82,84\n3.4.8.2 Multisystem disorder\nCyanosis and secondary erythrocytosis imply profound consequen-\nces for the entire organ system:82,84,85\n• Blood viscosity is increased and is directly related to red blood\ncell mass.84\n• Haemostatic abnormalities are common and complex and are\nattributed to abnormalities in platelets (thrombocytopaenia and\nthrombasthenia), coagulation pathways, and other abnormal\ncoagulation mechanisms. Vitamin K-dependent clotting factors\nand factor V are reduced, fibrinolytic activity is increased, and the\nlargest von Willebrand multimers are depleted.\n• Increased turnover of red blood cells/haemoglobin and impaired\nurate filtration lead to hyperuricaemia.86 The increased concen-\ntration of unconjugated bilirubin puts cyanotic patients at risk for\ncalcium bilirubinate gallstones.\n• Severe endothelial dysfunction is evident by the striking impair-\nment of endothelium-dependent vasodilation.85\n• Chronic hypoxaemia, increased blood viscosity, and endothelial\ndysfunction affect microcirculation, myocardial function, and the\nfunction of other organ systems.\n3.4.8.3 Clinical presentation and natural history\nClinical presentation includes central cyanosis, a result of an\nincreased quantity of reduced haemoglobin (>5 g/100 mL blood),\nclubbing, and frequently scoliosis. The underlying anatomy/patho-\nphysiology characterizes cardiac findings.\nMortality is significantly higher in cyanotic patients than in acyanotic\npatients.87 Outcome is determined by the underlying anatomy, patho-\nphysiology, palliative procedures, complications of cyanosis, and\npreventive measures.88,89 Low platelet count, severe hypoxia, cardio-\nmegaly, and elevated haematocrit during childhood are parameters to\npredict premature death and adverse events in patients with and with-\nout PVD.90 Iron deficiency is associated with adverse late outcome;91,92\nBNP can predict outcome in Eisenmenger patients.93,94 However, in a\nmulticentre study,89 only age, pre-tricuspid shunt, absence of sinus\nrhythm, lower oxygen saturation at rest, and presence of pericardial\neffusion, but not BNP, were the strongest predictors for death.\n3.4.8.4 Late complications\n• Hyperviscosity symptoms include headache, faintness, dizziness,\nfatigue, tinnitus, blurred vision, paraesthesia of fingers, toes, and\nlips, muscle pain, and weakness (classified moderate when they\ninterfere with some activities, severe when they interfere with\nmost activities).82,83 Hyperviscosity symptoms are unlikely in an\niron-replete patient with haematocrit <65%.\n• Bleeding and thrombotic diathesis occur; both cause a therapeu-\ntic dilemma (risks of thrombosis and bleeding). Spontaneous\nbleeding is usually minor, self-limiting (dental bleeding, epistaxis,\neasy bruising, menorrhagia). Haemoptysis is the most common\nmajor bleeding event and is an external manifestation of an intra-\npulmonary haemorrhage not reflecting the extent of parenchy-\nmal bleeding (reported in up to 100% of Eisenmenger\npatients).95,96 Thrombosis is caused by coagulation abnormalities,\nstasis of blood in dilated chambers and vessels, atherosclerosis\nand/or endothelial dysfunction, the presence of thrombogenic\nmaterial (e.g. conduits), and arrhythmias. The haemostatic abnor-\nmalities do not protect against thrombotic complications.\nLaminated thrombi in large, partially calcified and aneurysmal PAs\nare common (up to 30%).97\u0002100 Female sex, low oxygen satura-\ntion, older age, biventricular dysfunction, and dilated PAs have\nbeen identified as risk factors.97,100,101\n• Cerebrovascular infarctions are common, but underreported.97\nThey may be caused by thromboembolic events (paradoxical\nembolism, supraventricular arrhythmia), rheological factors\n(microcytosis), endothelial dysfunction, and traditional athero-\nsclerotic risk factors. The severity of secondary erythrocytosis is\nnot in itself a risk factor.102 Microcytosis caused by iron defi-\nciency, due to inappropriate phlebotomies, was the strongest\nindependent predictor for cerebrovascular events in one study.91\nSeverity of cyanosis and CHD complexity are other risk\nfactors.97\n• Paradoxical emboli may be caused by transvenous leads or\ncatheters.\n• Iron deficiency is frequently caused by, and may be exacerbated\nby, inappropriate phlebotomies or heavy menstruation in female\npatients.\n• Arrhythmias \u0002 supraventricular and ventricular.\n• Infectious complications include endocarditis, cerebral abscess,\nand pneumonia. Fever, associated with a new or different head-\nache, raises suspicion of a brain abscess.\n• Renal dysfunction is common and is due to functional and struc-\ntural abnormalities of the kidneys.\n• Cholelithiasis is common and can be complicated by cholecysti-\ntis/choledocholithiasis.\n• Rheumatological complications include gouty arthritis, hypertro-\nphic osteoarthropathy, and kyphoscoliosis.83\n3.4.8.5 Diagnostic aspects\nParticular attention must be paid to hyperviscosity symptoms and\nbleeding/ischaemic complications. Oxygen saturation must be\nobtained with pulse oximetry at rest for at least 5 min, and exercise\ncapacity should be assessed on a regular basis, preferably with a\n6MWT.\nBlood work must include cellular blood count, mean corpuscular\nvolume (MCV), serum ferritin (serum iron, iron saturation, transfer-\nrin, and transferrin saturation may be required for earlier detection\nof iron deficiency), creatinine, serum uric acid, clotting profile, BNP/\nNT-pro-BNP, folic acid, and vitamin B12 in the presence of elevated\nMCV or normal MCV and low serum ferritin.\n586\nESC Guidelines\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/6/563/5898606 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n..........................................................................................................\n3.4.8.6 Laboratory precautions\n• Coagulation parameters: plasma volume is reduced due to sec-\nondary erythrocytosis; the amount of sodium citrate must be\nadjusted to haematocrit if haematocrit is >55%.\n• Haematocrit determined with automated electronic particle\ncounts (micro-haematocrit centrifugation) results in falsely high\nhaematocrit due to plasma trapping.\n• Glucose level can be reduced (increased in vitro glycolysis, which\nresults from the increased number of erythrocytes).\n3.4.8.7 Indications for intervention\nRisk and benefit must be carefully considered and require expertise.\nCyanotic patients without PAH/Eisenmenger syndrome must be\nperiodically evaluated for any procedure that may improve quality of\nlife and reduce morbidity, or for eligibility for physiological repair (see\nsection 4.15).\n3.4.8.8 Medical therapy\n• Specific PAH treatment: see section 3.4.3.\n• Arrhythmias: sinus rhythm should be maintained whenever possi-\nble.

There is, however, an increased risk of bleeding.\n• Indication for anticoagulation: atrial flutter/AF (target INR 2\u00022.5;\nhigher target INR in the presence of other risk factors). Note lab-\noratory precautions: false high INR values are measured due to\nthe high haematocrit. There are no data and only anecdotal expe-\nriences about the use of NOACs (see also section 3.4.7).\n• Haemoptysis: requires chest computed tomography if there is an\ninfiltrate on the chest X-ray. Bronchoscopy puts the patient at\nrisk and seldom provides useful information. Therapy includes\ndiscontinuation\nof\naspirin,\nnon-steroidal\nanti-inflammatory\nagents, oral anticoagulants; treatment of hypovolaemia and anae-\nmia; reduction of physical activity; and suppression of non-\nproductive cough.

Gradual ascent up to 2500 m may\nbe tolerated.\n• Pregnancy: pregnancy in cyanotic patients, without PH, results in\nsignificant maternal and foetal complications and requires follow-\nup by a Pregnancy Heart Team. Oxygen saturation (>85%) and\nhaemoglobin (<200 g/L) before pregnancy were the strongest\npredictors for live birth in one series.106 Pregnancy should be\nstrongly discouraged in Eisenmenger syndrome and in cyanotic\npatients without PAH, but an arterial oxygen saturation <90%43\n(see section 3.5.7).\n• IE prophylaxis: recommended in all patients (see section 3.4.6).\n3.5 Additional considerations\n3.5.1\nSex differences\nWomen have been appropriately included in trials, and sex-stratified\nanalyses are available to some extent. Data regarding sex difference\non prevalence of CHD, morbidity, and mortality are con-\nflicting.76,107\u0002110 Although no differences in mortality were noted in\nthe CONgenital CORvitia (CONCOR) study, there were significant\nsex differences in morbidity (increased risk for PH for women, but\nlower risk for IE, aortic complications, and ICD implantation).111\nWhether these differences relate to genetic and inherent biological\ndifference, smaller body size, or other not yet defined differences\nwarrants further exploration.112\nSex differences are important for diagnostic evaluation and clinical\ndecision making. Although recommendations are usually not sex spe-\ncific, body surface area (BSA)-normalized cut-offs of aortic and car-\ndiac chamber dimensions may correct for smaller BSA in women.113\nPersonalized counselling is essential in women contemplating preg-\nnancy, as indications for intervention in females may set lower abso-\nlute\nvalues\nfor\naortic\nsurgery\n(hereditary/CHD-associated\naortopathy) or for pulmonary valve replacement (PVRep) in patients\nwith TOF.112\nThere are data showing different impacts for men than women for\nemployment,114 gaps in medical care,115 and physical activity.116\nClinical evaluation, decision making, and counselling may require tai-\nloring to the individual to help ensure equity of outcomes.\n3.5.2\nAdult congenital heart disease at more advanced\nage\nTo date, \u000390% of patients with mild, 75% with moderate, and 40%\nwith complex heart defects reach the age of 60 years.117 These\nproportions are expected to rise further in the upcoming decades.\nHence, there is a growing population of older persons with CHD\nand\nunique\nhealthcare\nneeds.\nThese\nolder\npatients\nare\ncharacterized by more comorbidities, inherent age-related risk for\narrhythmia (especially AF), accelerated ageing, acquired disease,\nchanged responses to medication, earlier onset of geriatric syn-\ndromes (e.g. cognitive decline, immobility/falls, failure to thrive,\nsensory alterations), and an altered psychosocial profile.118,119\nDedicated guidelines for older patients with CHD ought to be\nconsulted to provide adequate care to this more vulnerable\npatient population.120 The onset of acquired diseases starts early\nin life, therefore, prevention strategies ought to be implemented\nin the first decades of life (at paediatric cardiology).\n3.5.3\nAdvance care planning and end-of-life care\nMost patients, independent of defect complexity, wish to discuss\nlife expectancy prior to being confronted with life-threatening\ncomplications.121 Such complications may occur during high-risk\ninterventions or reflect an uncertain illness trajectory. Timely dis-\ncussion of advance care planning is a critical component of\npatient-centred, comprehensive care.121,122 Initiation of this\ndemanding conversation is difficult. Unplanned hospital admis-\nsions, ICD insertion, or functional decline can serve as a trigger\nfor such conversations. Most patients do not start advance\ncare planning discussions on their own and wait for the provider’s\ninitiative. The content of advance care planning discussions\ndepends on the patient’s physical and psychological health and\npreferences. Initially, discussion about life expectancy and treat-\nment preferences may be all the patient wants. With deteriorat-\ning health, a holistic assessment of the patient’s wishes and\nvalues, advance directives, nomination of a surrogate decision\nmaker, and decisions regarding device therapies in ICD patients\nare required.\nDuring the process of care, active disease-specific treatment may\nprogressively become supported and eventually substituted by pallia-\ntive care. Involvement of palliative care specialists can be supportive.\nAt any time, it is important to emphasize that active disease-specific\ncare might continue during the advance care planning process, even\nnear the end of life, keeping in line with patients’ preferences and\ngoals. The role of palliative care and family support continues after\nthe patient’s death in managing bereavement care.123\nWhenever possible, family members should be involved in all\nsteps. Patient preferences can change over time and periodic re-\nevaluation of the patient’s wishes is necessary.\n3.5.4\nInsurance and employment\nFor ACHD patients, it is often difficult to obtain life-, health-, or travel\ninsurance, and mortgages.124\u0002126 If insurance is granted, patients fre-\nquently need to pay an extra charge or the heart defect as a pre-\nexisting condition excludes them from insurance. In general, obtain-\ning insurance or not, and the higher fee, are mostly unrelated to the\ncomplexity of the defect, the functional status of the patient, or the\nprognosis,124,126 but are rather a function of the policies of insurance\ncompanies and reflect a large inter- and intra-country variation.\nPatients currently need to shop around, and both clinicians and\npatient associations may be of help. Insurability is a definite issue that\nshould be discussed during patient counselling. Also, employment, in\nparticular the requirements for specific professions, needs atten-\ntion.127 Starting in adolescence, choices about education should be\n588\nESC Guidelines\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/6/563/5898606 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n.............................................................................................................................................................................\nmade based on the possibilities to perform heavy exercise and work\nnight shifts, and the use of specific medication such as oral\nanticoagulation.\n3.5.5\nExercise and sports\nRecommendations for exercise and sports need to be based on the\nunderlying congenital heart defect and its potential complications, the\nhaemodynamic and EP status of the patient, and their pre-existing fit-\nness.24 Counselling must consider the type of sport and the anticipated\neffort levels. In general, physicians have been over-conservative in their\nadvice, especially as physical activity has well-documented benefits for\nfitness, psychological well-being, and social interaction, as well as a posi-\ntive effect on the future risk of acquired heart disease; symptoms do\nnot exclude physical activity. Dynamic exercise is more suitable than\nstatic exercise. In addition, in patients with known cardiac conditions,\ncomplications\nduring\nexercise,\nincluding\nSCD,\nare\nrare.128\nRecommendations for participation in low- to high-intensity sports are\ndiscussed in the position paper of Budts et al.24 Guidelines on elite\nsports in athletes with CHD are described in the 2020 ESC Guidelines\non sports cardiology.129 Assessment of physical exercise capacity\nshould be done before recommending recreational exercise or sport\nin order to avoid intense exercise in untrained patients. Most patients\nwith CHD can safely engage in regular, moderate physical activity. A\nfew conditions, such as systemic ventricular systolic dysfunction, sys-\ntemic ventricular outflow tract obstruction, PH, haemodynamically sig-\nnificant arrhythmias, or aortic dilation, warrant more caution.\n3.5.6\nNon-cardiac surgery\nThe evaluation and management of ACHD patients should follow\nthe principles of the 2014 ESC Guidelines on non-cardiac surgery130\nand consider the specificities of CHD. Factors associated with\nincreased risk of perioperative morbidity and mortality are cyanosis,\ncongestive heart failure, poor general health, younger age, PH, opera-\ntions on the respiratory and nervous systems, complex CHD, and\nurgent/emergency procedures. In patients with complex CHD\n(Fontan, Eisenmenger syndrome, cyanotic patients), non-cardiac sur-\ngical and interventional procedures should be performed in an expert\ncentre.130,131 Issues to consider are endocarditis prophylaxis, compli-\ncations related to underlying haemodynamics, abnormal venous and/\nor arterial anatomy affecting venous and arterial access, persistent\nshunts, valvular disease, arrhythmias including bradyarrhythmias,\nerythrocytosis, pulmonary vascular disease (PVD), prevention of\nvenous thrombosis, monitoring of renal and liver function, periproce-\ndural anticoagulation, possible need for non-conventional drug dos-\ning, increased prevalence of hepatitis C infection because of prior\nprocedures and remote blood transfusions and, finally, developmen-\ntal disability.\n3.5.7\nPregnancy, contraception, and genetic counselling\n3.5.7.1 Pregnancy and contraception\nThe majority of ACHD patients tolerate pregnancy well, but\nwomen with complex CHD have higher risks. Detailed ESC\nGuidelines on pregnancy and heart disease were published in 2018.43\nPre-pregnancy counselling should be provided to all women with\nCHD. Specialist care is best provided in a multidisciplinary team set-\nting by the Pregnancy Heart Team. This team should have input from\nACHD cardiology, obstetrics, and anaesthesia, and where necessary\nfrom other specialists, including clinical geneticists. The team should\nbe involved in all patients with at least moderate to complex heart\ndisease before pregnancy for timely counselling and advice during\npregnancy in order to plan antenatal care, including delivery and\npost-partum follow-up and need for cardiac monitoring. Risk estima-\ntion should be individualized and based on the modified WHO\n(mWHO) classification (Table 10).43\nFunctional status before pregnancy, ventricular function, severity\nof the lesions, and history of previous cardiac events are also of prog-\nnostic value.132 CPET performed before conception can predict\nmaternal and neonatal outcomes. A blunted heart rate response to\nexercise is associated with a higher risk of maternal cardiac and neo-\nnatal adverse events.\nMaternal mortality is 0\u00021% and heart failure complicates pregnancy\nin 11% of women with heart disease, with PAH being associated with\nthe highest risks.133,134 Cyanosis poses a significant risk to the foetus,\nwith live birth unlikely (<12%) if oxygen saturation is <85%.106\nWomen with cardiac disease also have an increased risk of obstet-\nric complications, including premature labour, pre-eclampsia, and\npostpartum haemorrhage.135 The potential for drugs affecting the\nfoetus should always be considered; angiotensin-converting enzyme\n(ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), in par-\nticular, should not be used. Women requiring oral anticoagulation\ndeserve special attention. VKAs are teratogenic, especially at higher\ndoses. A dose-adjusted treatment algorithm is proposed in the 2018\nESC Guidelines on pregnancy.43\nThe pregnancy duration and mode of delivery should be\ndecided by the Pregnancy Heart Team, taking the CHD severity\ninto account.\nContraception should be discussed in a timely fashion with specific\nattention to effectiveness and safety.136 Barrier methods are safe and\nprotect against sexually transmitted diseases, however, they only\nhave a high contraceptive efficacy with compliant couples. Hormonal\ncontraceptives are highly efficacious, but there are few data on their\nsafety in the ACHD population. The combined oral contraceptive is\nhighly effective (99.9%), but is best avoided in patients with a pre-\nexisting thrombotic risk (cyanosis, Fontan physiology, mechanical\nvalves, prior thrombotic events, PAH), especially as there are few\ndata to suggest that concomitant oral anticoagulation therapy will\nnegate this risk. Progesterone-only contraceptives, on the other\nhand, do not pose such a high thrombosis risk, and newer prepara-\ntions available for oral administration or with intrauterine implants\nhave a high efficacy (>95%). The risk of endocarditis after insertion of\nprogesterone-coated intrauterine devices is probably low. However,\nthere is a risk of vasovagal reactions (5%) at the time of insertion or\nremoval. Patients with a fragile physiology (e.g. patients with a Fontan\ncirculation, PH, cyanotic CHD, Eisenmenger syndrome) should have\ntheir intrauterine device inserted/removed in a safe environment (i.e.\nin an environment with expertise in ACHD). Female sterilization or\nmale partner sterilization should only be considered after careful dis-\ncussion, with particular reference to long-term prognosis.\nAssisted reproduction has added risks above those of pregnancy\nalone, and consultation with an ACHD specialist must be performed\nbefore treatment.

The last option is strongly\nadvised in women with heart disease, since conceiving a multiple\npregnancy is associated with greater cardiovascular changes and\nmore maternal and foetal complications.138 Pregnancy and fertility\ntreatment are contraindicated in women with mWHO classification\nof maternal cardiovascular risk class IV.43 In women with mWHO\nclass III, or those who are anticoagulated, the risk of superovulation is\nvery high and the alternative of natural cycle in vitro fertilization\nshould be considered.\nSexuality is an important element of quality of life. The few avail-\nable data suggest that sexual function is a concern in both women\nand men and should be discussed more often.139\n3.5.7.2 Genetic counselling and recurrence risk\nGenetic counselling, whether supplemented with further genetic\ntesting or not, should at least be considered for every ACHD patient.\nDemonstrating a genetic abnormality can be important to further\nadjust the patient’s own management and is evidently also important\nfor family planning. It is estimated that 10\u000230% of all structural CHD\nwould have a genetic basis. This rate is higher in cases of associated\norgan disorders and familial occurrence, and lower in isolated cases.\nWith the rapid technical progress and possibilities of genetic testing,\nthe reliability of these tests is further improving. Naturally, genetic\nelaboration in each patient must be multidisciplinary, with integration\nof necessary clinical data and adequate interpretation of found\ngenetic variants. A detailed consensus document on this subject, pro-\nviding an algorithm for genetic testing and an overview of the main\nsyndromes to consider, has recently been published.140\nOne of the important and specific aspects of genetic counselling is\nthe assessment of recurrence risk, which needs consideration in both\nmen and women. The recurrence rate of CHD in offspring ranges\nfrom 2\u000250% and is higher in affected women than men.

An overview is provided in\nTable 11. Foetal echocardiography in affected couples is recom-\nmended at 19\u000222 weeks gestation and can be done as early as\n15\u000216 weeks gestation.\n4 Specific lesions\n4.1 Atrial septal defect and anomalous\npulmonary venous connection\n4.1.1\nIntroduction and background\nASD can remain undiagnosed until adulthood. ASD types include:\n• Secundum ASD (80% of ASDs; located in the region of the fossa\novalis and its surrounding).\n• Primum ASD [15%; synonyms: partial AV septal defect [atrioven-\ntricular septal defect (AVSD) with communication on the atrial\nlevel only], partial AV canal; located near the crux, AV valves are\ntypically malformed, resulting in various degrees of regurgitation\n(see section 4.3)].\n• Superior sinus venosus defect [5%; located near the superior\nvena cava (SVC) entry, associated with partial or complete con-\nnection of right pulmonary veins to SVC/RA].\n• Inferior sinus venosus defect [<1%; located near the inferior vena\ncava (IVC) entry].\n• Unroofed coronary sinus [<1%; separation from the left atrium\n(LA) can be partially or completely missing].\nAssociated lesions include anomalous pulmonary venous connec-\ntion, persistent left SVC, pulmonary valve stenosis, and mitral valve\nprolapse. Interatrial defects are the most frequently associated\ndefects in Ebstein anomaly (see section 4.9). Treatment decisions are\nmore complex in the latter combination. The present section deals\nwith isolated ASD.\nThe shunt volume depends on RV/LV compliance, defect size, and\nLA/RA pressure. A simple ASD results in L\u0002R shunt because of the\nhigher compliance of the RV compared with the LV (relevant shunt in\ngeneral with defect sizes >_10 mm), and causes RV volume overload\nand pulmonary overcirculation. Reduction in LV compliance, or any\ncondition with elevation of LA pressure (hypertension, ischaemic heart\ndisease, cardiomyopathy, aortic and mitral valve disease), increases\nL\u0002R shunt. As a consequence, an ASD may become haemodynami-\ncally more important with age. Reduced RV compliance (pulmonic\nstenosis, PAH, other RV disease) or TV disease may decrease L\u0002R\nshunt or eventually cause shunt reversal, resulting in cyanosis.\n4.1.2\nClinical presentation and natural history\nPatients frequently remain asymptomatic until adulthood. However,\nthe majority develop symptoms beyond the fourth decade including\nreduced functional capacity, exertional shortness of breath, and palpi-\ntations (supraventricular tachyarrhythmias), and less frequently pul-\nmonary infections and right heart failure. Life expectancy is reduced\noverall, but survival is much better than previously assumed.142 PAP\ncan be normal, but on average increases with age. Severe PVD is\nnevertheless very rare (<5%); its development presumably requires\nadditional factors and the disease course is similar to idiopathic\nPAH.48 With increasing age, and with increasing PAP, tachyarrhyth-\nmias become more common (atrial flutter, AF).143 Systemic embolism\nmay be caused by paradoxical embolism (rare) or AF and atrial flutter.\n4.1.3\nDiagnostic work-up\nSee section 3.3 for general principles.\nKey clinical findings include fixed splitting of the second heart\nsound and a systolic pulmonary flow murmur. ECG typically shows\nan incomplete right bundle branch block and right-axis deviation\n(superior left-axis deviation in partial AVSD). An increased pulmo-\nnary vascularity on chest X-ray is frequently overlooked.\n• Echocardiography is the first-line diagnostic technique, providing\ndiagnosis and quantification. RV volume overload, which may be\nthe first unexpected finding in a patient with previously undiag-\nnosed ASD, is the key finding and best characterizes the haemo-\ndynamic relevance of the defect (preferable to the shunt ratio).\nSinus venosus defects in general require TOE for accurate diag-\nnosis (CMR/CCT is an alternative and superior in case of inferior\nsinus venosus defects). TOE is also required for precise evalua-\ntion of secundum defects before device closure, which should\ninclude sizing, exploration of the residual septum’s morphology,\nthe rim size and quality, exclusion of additional defects, and con-\nfirmation of a normal pulmonary venous connection. 3D echo-\ncardiography provides visualization of ASD morphology. Other\nkey information to be provided includes PAP and tricuspid regur-\ngitation (TR).\n• CMR is rarely required but may be useful for assessment of RV\nvolume overload, identification of inferior sinus venosus defect,\nquantification of pulmonary to systemic flow ratio (Qp:Qs), and\nevaluation of pulmonary venous connection (alternatively for the\nlatter, use CCT).\n• Cardiac catheterization is required in case of non-invasive signs\nof PAP elevation (calculated systolic PAP >40 mmHg or indirect\nsigns when PAP cannot be estimated) to determine PVR.\n• Exercise testing should be performed in patients with PAH to\nexclude desaturation.\n4.1.4\nSurgical/catheter interventional treatment\nIndications for intervention are summarized in the Recommendations\nfor intervention in atrial septal defect (native and residual) table and in\nFigure 2.\nSurgical repair has low mortality (<1% in patients without signifi-\ncant comorbidity) and good long-term outcome when performed\nearly (childhood, adolescence) and in the absence of PH.144,145\nAlthough surgical repair can be performed with very low risk, even in\nthe elderly, comorbidities that may affect operative risk need to be\nconsidered and then risk weighed against potential benefit.\nESC Guidelines\n591\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/6/563/5898606 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n.............................................................................................................................................................................\nDevice closure has become the first choice for secundum defect clo-\nsure, when feasible, based on the morphology (includes stretched\ndiameter <_38 mm and sufficient rim of 5 mm except towards the\naorta). This is the case in \u000380% of patients. Although it cannot be\nassumed to be zero, several recent studies have reported no mortality.\nSerious complications have been observed in <_1% of patients.148,149\nAtrial tachyarrhythmias occurring early after intervention are mostly\ntransient. Erosion of the atrial wall, anterior mitral leaflet, or the aorta,\nas well as thromboembolic events, appear to be very rare.150,151\nAntiplatelet therapy is required for at least 6 months (aspirin 75 mg\no.d. minimum). Potential incidence of late arrhythmias or adverse\nevents still requires investigation. Studies comparing surgery and cathe-\nter intervention have reported similar success rates and mortality, but\nmorbidity was lower and hospital stays shorter with catheter interven-\ntion while reintervention rate was slightly higher.148,152\nOutcome is best with repair at age <25 years.144,145 ASD closure\nafter the age of 40 years appears not to affect the frequency of\narrhythmia development during follow-up.146,153 However, the\npatient’s morbidity benefits from closure at any age (exercise\ncapacity, shortness of breath, right heart failure), particularly when it\ncan be done by catheter intervention.146,153\nIn patients with impaired LV function (systolic and diastolic), ASD\nclosure may worsen heart failure. These patients must be carefully eval-\nuated and may require pre-interventional testing (balloon occlusion\nwith reassessment of haemodynamics) to decide between complete,\nfenestrated, or no closure, considering that an increase in filling pres-\nsure due to ASD closure may worsen symptoms and outcome.154\nPatients with PH must be evaluated with particular care.\nCalculation of PVR is mandatory. In patients with PVR <5 WU, ASD\nclosure has been shown to be safe and associated with a decrease in\nPAP and improvement of symptoms.60,153,155 However, even in this\ngroup, the extent of improvement decreases with increasing PAP.\nPatients with PVR >_5 WU are unlikely to improve60 and likely to\nhave an even worse outcome with complete ASD closure.48,156\nVasoreactivity testing is not recommended when making the decision\nwhether to close an ASD in patients with PVR >_5 WU. It appears\nsafer to treat PAH, re-evaluate haemodynamics during follow-up, and\nconsider fenestrated closure only when PVR falls below 5 WU in the\npresence of significant L\u0002R shunt. If this is not the case, ASD closure\nshould be avoided.\nIn patients with atrial flutter/AF, cryo- or radiofrequency ablation\n(modified maze procedure) should be considered at the time of sur-\ngery. Device closure may restrict access to the LA for later EP\ninterventions.\nIn patients of advanced age with ASDs not suitable for device clo-\nsure, individual surgical risk due to comorbidities must be carefully\nweighed against the potential benefits of ASD closure.\n4.1.5\nSpecific aspects of isolated anomalous pulmonary\nvenous connections\nAnomalous pulmonary venous connections do not only occur in\nassociation with ASD (typically in sinus venous defects) but can also\nbe isolated. This results in volume overload of the right heart, with a\nphysiological effect similar to that of an ASD, but when isolated, dif-\nfers in that there is no potential for R\u0002L shunting, and the magnitude\nof the L\u0002R shunt is not exacerbated by the development of acquired\nleft heart disease. Most common is the connection of the right upper\npulmonary vein to the SVC. Other abnormal connections include\nright pulmonary vein(s) to the IVC (‘scimitar vein’, which may be\nassociated with sequestration of the right lower lobe), left upper\nRecommendations for intervention in atrial septal\ndefect (native and residual)\nRecommendations\nClassa\nLevelb\nIn patients with evidence of RV volume over-\nloadc and no PAH (no non-invasive signs of PAP\nelevation or invasive conﬁrmation of PVR <3\nWU in case of such signs) or LV disease, ASD\nclosure is recommended regardless of\nsymptoms.146,147\nI\nB\nDevice closure is recommended as the method\nof choice for secundum ASD closure when\ntechnically suitable.\nI\nC\nIn elderly patients not suitable for device clo-\nsure, it is recommended to carefully weigh the\nsurgical risk against the potential beneﬁt of ASD\nclosure.\nI\nC\nIn patients with non-invasive signs of PAP eleva-\ntion, invasive measurement of PVR is\nmandatory.\nI\nC\nIn patients with LV disease, it is recommended\nto perform balloon testing and carefully weigh\nthe beneﬁt of eliminating L\u0002R shunt against the\npotential negative impact of ASD closure on\noutcome due to an increase in ﬁlling pressure\n(taking closure, fenestrated closure, and no clo-\nsure into consideration).\nI\nC\nIn patients with suspicion of paradoxical embo-\nlism (exclusion of other causes), ASD closure\nshould be considered regardless of size provid-\ning there is absence of PAH and LV disease.\nIIa\nC\nIn patients with PVR 3\u00025 WU, ASD closure\nshould be considered when signiﬁcant L\u0002R\nshunt is present (Qp:Qs >1.5).\nIIa\nC\nIn patients with PVR >_5 WU, fenestrated ASD\nclosure may be considered when PVR falls\nbelow 5 WU after targeted PAH treatment and\nsigniﬁcant L\u0002R shunt is present (Qp:Qs >1.5).\nIIb\nC\nASD closure is not recommended in patients\nwith Eisenmenger physiology, patients with PAH\nand PVR >_5 WU despite targeted PAH treat-\nment, or desaturation on exercise.d\nIII\nC\nASD = atrial septal defect; L\u0002R = left-to-right; LV = left ventricle/ventricular;\nPAH = pulmonary arterial hypertension; PAP = pulmonary artery pressure; PVR\n= pulmonary vascular resistance; Qp:Qs = pulmonary to systemic ﬂow ratio; RV\n= right ventricle/ventricular; WU = Wood units.\naClass of recommendation.\nbLevel of evidence.\ncRV enlargement with increased stroke volume.\ndThere are limited data available for a precise cut-off, but by clinical experience,\nthis would be given by a fall of arterial oxygen saturation <90%.\n592\nESC Guidelines\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/6/563/5898606 by guest on 14 January 2026",

Without repair or with\nrepair after age 40 years, AF becomes more common. In patients who\nundergo ASD closure aged >40 years, the prevalence of atrial arrhyth-\nmias is up to 40\u000260%.

Patients with pre-capillary\nPH should be counselled against pregnancy (see section 3.5.7).\n• IE prophylaxis: recommended for 6 months after device closure\n(see section 3.4.6).\n4.2 Ventricular septal defect\n4.2.1\nIntroduction and background\nVSD is mostly diagnosed and \u0002 when indicated \u0002 treated before adult-\nhood. Spontaneous closure is frequent in childhood. Several locations\nof the defect within the interventricular septum are possible, and these\ncan be divided into four groups according to their location within the\nRV (nomenclature varies and synonyms are added):157\n• Perimembranous/paramembranous/subaortic/conoventricular\n(most common, \u000380% of VSDs; located in the membranous sep-\ntum with possible extension into inlet, trabecular, or outlet sep-\ntum; adjacent to tricuspid and aortic valve; so-called aneurysms of\nthe membranous septum \u0002 i.e. tissue from the septal leaflet of the\nTV \u0002 are frequent and may result in partial or complete closure).\n• Muscular/trabecular (up to 15\u000220%; completely surrounded by\nmuscle; various locations; frequently multiple; spontaneous clo-\nsure particularly frequent).\n• Outlet (with or without malalignment of the outlet septum)/\nsupracristal/subarterial/subpulmonary/infundibular/conal/doubly\ncommitted juxta-arterial [\u00035%; located beneath the semilunar\nvalves in the conal or outlet septum; may be associated with pro-\ngressive aortic regurgitation (AR) due to prolapse of the right\naortic cusp and aneurysm of the sinus of Valsalva].\n• Inlet/AV canal/AVSD type (inlet of the ventricular septum imme-\ndiately inferior to the AV valve apparatus; associated with a com-\nmon AV valve; may be associated with AV septal malalignment\nand straddling TV; typically occurring in Down syndrome).\nOften there is one single defect, but multiple defects do occur.\nVSD is also a common component of complex anomalies, such as\nTOF, transposition of the great arteries (TGA), and congenitally cor-\nrected TGA (ccTGA). Spontaneous closure occurs mainly during\nchildhood and is uncommon in outlet defects.158\nThe direction and magnitude of the shunt are determined by PVR\nand systemic vascular resistance, the size of the defect, LV/RV systolic\nand diastolic function, and the presence of right ventricular outflow\ntract (RVOT) obstruction (RVOTO) and left ventricular outflow\ntract (LVOT) obstruction (LVOTO).\n4.2.2\nClinical presentation and natural history\nThe usual clinical presentations in adults include:\n• VSD operated on in childhood, without residual VSD and no PH.\n• VSD operated on in childhood, with residual VSD. The residual\nshunt size determines the degree of LV volume overload and the\ndevelopment of PH.\n• Small VSD with insignificant L\u0002R shunt, without LV volume over-\nload or PH (restrictive VSD), which was not considered for sur-\ngery in childhood.\n• VSD with L\u0002R shunt, PH (various degrees), and various degrees\nof LV volume overload (rare).\n• VSD with R\u0002L shunt (Eisenmenger syndrome): large, non-\nrestrictive, VSD with originally large L\u0002R shunt and development\nof severe PVD eventually resulting in shunt reversal (cyanosis;\nsee sections 3.4.3 and 3.4.8).\nA large majority of patients with a VSD that has been closed\nentirely in childhood (spontaneously or surgically), or patients with a\nsmall VSD who were either never operated on or who had a residual\ndefect after surgical repair with no LV volume overload on echocar-\ndiography, usually remain asymptomatic and do not require further\nsurgery.159 However, an unknown percentage of patients with a small\nresidual VSD develop problems later in life.160 Survival 40 years after\nclosure appears to remain slightly lower than in the general\npopulation.161\nSeveral possible problems may occur with advancing age:\n• A double-chambered RV (DCRV) can develop over time, mostly\nin perimembranous defects, and may be a result of the jet lesion\nof the RV endothelium caused by the high-velocity VSD jet.\n• In the case of an outlet (supracristal) VSD (less commonly\nperimembranous), there is a risk for prolapse of the right cor-\nonary (or non-coronary) cusp of the aortic valve, resulting in\nprogressive AR and formation of a sinus of Valsalva aneurysm.\n• Arrhythmias can occur, but are less frequent than in other forms\nof CHD162.\n• Complete heart block \u0002 rare nowadays \u0002 was not uncommon\nin the earlier years of cardiac smurgery, so can occur, especially\nin older patients. These patients usually require lifelong pacing.\n• Late LV dysfunction and heart failure.\n• Endocarditis.\n4.2.3\nDiagnostic work-up\nSee section 3.3 for general principles.\nSpecific clinical findings include a holosystolic murmur over the third\nto fourth left intercostal space, and a precordial thrill may be felt.\n• Echocardiography is the key diagnostic technique, in general\nproviding the diagnosis and assessment of disease severity. Key\nfindings to provide are location, number, and size of defects,\nseverity of LV volume overload, and estimated PAP. AR due to\nprolapse of the right or non-coronary cusp must be checked for,\nespecially in the case of outlet (supracristal) and high perimem-\nbranous VSDs. DCRV and sinus of Valsalva aneurysm must be\nexcluded.\n• CMR can serve as an alternative if echocardiography is insuffi-\ncient, particularly for assessment of LV volume overload and\nshunt quantification.\n• Cardiac catheterization is required in case of non-invasive\nsigns of PAP elevation (calculated systolic PAP >40 mmHg or\nindirect signs when PAP cannot be estimated) to determine\nPVR.\n• Exercise testing should be performed in patients with PAH to\nexclude desaturation.\n594\nESC Guidelines\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/6/563/5898606 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n.........................................................................................................................................................................\n4.2.4\nSurgical/catheter interventional treatment\nIndications for intervention are summarized in the Recommendations\nfor intervention in ventricular septal defect (native and residual) table and\nin Figure 3.\nSurgical closure can be performed with low operative mortality\n(1\u00022%) and good long-term results.163 Transcatheter closure has\nbecome an alternative, particularly in residual VSDs, in VSDs that are\npoorly accessible for surgical closure, and in muscular VSDs that are\nlocated centrally in the interventricular septum. In perimembranous\nVSD, it has been shown to be feasible. Whether the risk of complete\nAV block and entrapment of TV tissue leading to TR, or the risk of\nAR that has been observed in children, is relevant in adults under-\ngoing interventional closure of a perimembranous VSD remains to\nbe seen.\nPatients eligible for VSD closure at adult age are rare. Most\npatients have either small VSDs with insignificant shunt or have\nalready developed PH. The latter must be evaluated with particular\ncaution. Patients with shunt closure and persistent/progressive PAH\nappear to have a particularly poor outcome.48\n4.2.5\nFollow-up recommendations\nDevelopment of AR or TR, degree of (residual) shunt, LV dysfunc-\ntion, elevation of PAP, or development of DCRV, should be excluded\nor assessed if present by echocardiography.\nPossible development of complete AV block requires attention\n(patients who develop bifascicular block or transient trifascicular\nblock after VSD closure are at risk in later years for the development\nof complete AV block).\nPatients with more than small residual VSD, valvular lesions, or\nhaemodynamic impairment (LV dysfunction or PAH) should be seen\nevery year, including evaluation in specialized ACHD centres. In\npatients with a small VSD (native or residual, normal LV, normal PAP,\nasymptomatic) and no other lesion, 3\u00025-year intervals may be rea-\nsonable. After device closure, regular follow-up during the first 2\nyears and then, depending on the results, every 2\u00025 years is reason-\nable. After surgical closure without residual abnormality, 5-year inter-\nvals may be reasonable.\n4.2.6\nAdditional considerations\n• Exercise/sports:\nno\nrestrictions\nare\nrequired\nin\npatients\nafter VSD closure, or with small VSD without PH, significant\narrhythmias, or LV dysfunction. Patients with PAH must limit\nthemselves to low-intensity recreational activity/sports (see sec-\ntion 3.5.5).\n• Pregnancy: patients with pre-capillary PH (PAH) should be coun-\nselled against pregnancy. The risk is low in asymptomatic patients\nwith normal LV and no PAH (see section 3.5.7).\n• IE prophylaxis: recommended only for high-risk patients (see sec-\ntion 3.4.6).\n4.3 Atrioventricular septal defect\n4.3.1\nIntroduction and background\nAn AVSD (AV canal or endocardial cushion defect) is character-\nized by the presence of a common AV junction. The partial AVSD\nusually has a defect only at the atrial level (primum ASD) or, in\nrare cases, only at the ventricular level. The anterior and posterior\nbridging leaflets are fused centrally, creating separate left- and\nright-sided orifices. In a complete AVSD, the central fusion is not\npresent and there is only one orifice. A complete AVSD (complete\nAV canal) has a septal defect in the crux of the heart, extending\ninto both the interatrial and interventricular septum (non-restric-\ntive inlet VSD). The AV node is positioned posterior and inferior\nto the coronary sinus. The bundle of His and the left bundle branch\nare displaced posteriorly. This accounts for an abnormal activation\nsequence of the ventricles (prolongation of AV conduction time,\nleft-axis deviation) and is important to recognize during EP studies\nand catheter ablation.\nMost complete AVSDs occur in Down syndrome patients (>75%),\nand most partial AVSDs occur in non-Down syndrome patients\n(>90%).

The partial AVSD\nusually has a defect only at the atrial level (primum ASD) or, in\nrare cases, only at the ventricular level. The anterior and posterior\nbridging leaflets are fused centrally, creating separate left- and\nright-sided orifices. In a complete AVSD, the central fusion is not\npresent and there is only one orifice. A complete AVSD (complete\nAV canal) has a septal defect in the crux of the heart, extending\ninto both the interatrial and interventricular septum (non-restric-\ntive inlet VSD). The AV node is positioned posterior and inferior\nto the coronary sinus. The bundle of His and the left bundle branch\nare displaced posteriorly. This accounts for an abnormal activation\nsequence of the ventricles (prolongation of AV conduction time,\nleft-axis deviation) and is important to recognize during EP studies\nand catheter ablation.\nMost complete AVSDs occur in Down syndrome patients (>75%),\nand most partial AVSDs occur in non-Down syndrome patients\n(>90%). AVSD may occur in association with TOF and other forms\nof complex CHD.

The partial AVSD\nusually has a defect only at the atrial level (primum ASD) or, in\nrare cases, only at the ventricular level. The anterior and posterior\nbridging leaflets are fused centrally, creating separate left- and\nright-sided orifices. In a complete AVSD, the central fusion is not\npresent and there is only one orifice. A complete AVSD (complete\nAV canal) has a septal defect in the crux of the heart, extending\ninto both the interatrial and interventricular septum (non-restric-\ntive inlet VSD). The AV node is positioned posterior and inferior\nto the coronary sinus. The bundle of His and the left bundle branch\nare displaced posteriorly. This accounts for an abnormal activation\nsequence of the ventricles (prolongation of AV conduction time,\nleft-axis deviation) and is important to recognize during EP studies\nand catheter ablation.\nMost complete AVSDs occur in Down syndrome patients (>75%),\nand most partial AVSDs occur in non-Down syndrome patients\n(>90%). AVSD may occur in association with TOF and other forms\nof complex CHD. An AVSD with unequal position of the common\nAV valve above the ventricles is accompanied by a variable degree of\nventricular hypoplasia (unbalanced AVSD).

Symptoms\nare not specific for an AVSD and are caused by intracardiac shunt-\ning (L\u0002R, R\u0002L, or bidirectional), PH, AV valve regurgitation, ven-\ntricular dysfunction, or LVOTO. Exercise intolerance, dyspnoea,\narrhythmia, and cyanosis may be present. LVOTO (subvalvular)\nmay be present or develop over time. Complete AV block may\ndevelop late.\nThe\nhistory\nof\nunoperated\ncomplete\nAVSD\nis\nthat\nof\nEisenmenger syndrome unless the VSD is only small (see sections\n3.4.3 and 3.4.8).\nUnrepaired primum ASD (partial AVSD) is not uncommon in\nadults. The presenting clinical symptoms are that of an L\u0002R shunt at\nthe atrial level (see section 4.1) and/or that of left-sided AV valve\nregurgitation (‘cleft’). Patients may still be asymptomatic, but symp-\ntoms tend to increase with age; most adults are symptomatic by 40\nyears of age.\n4.3.3\nDiagnostic work-up\nSee section 3.3 for general principles.\nClinical findings depend on the individual variant (see sections 4.3.1\nand 4.3.2).\n• Echocardiography is the key diagnostic technique. It provides\nassessment of each anatomic component of the AVSD, of the AV\nvalves and their connections, the severity and exact substrate of\nAV valve regurgitation, the magnitude and direction of intracar-\ndiac shunting, LV and RV function, PAP, and assessment of the\npresence/absence of LVOTO.\n• CMR is indicated when additional quantification of ventricular\nvolumes and function, AV valve regurgitation, or intracardiac\nshunting is required for decision making.\n• Cardiac catheterization is required in case of non-invasive signs\nof PAP elevation (calculated systolic PAP >40 mmHg or indirect\nsigns when PAP cannot be estimated) to determine PVR.\n• Exercise testing should be performed in patients with PAH to\nexclude desaturation.\n4.3.4\nSurgical/catheter interventional treatment\nCatheter closure of AVSDs is not feasible, and intervention is there-\nfore surgical (defect closure, valve repair). In cases of residual intera-\ntrial or interventricular communications, endocardial pacing causes\nan elevated risk of paradoxical emboli; this should be taken into\naccount when pacing is indicated. Epicardial pacing may be required.\nThe expertise of a congenital cardiac surgeon is recommended for all\nkinds of AVSD defect closures and AV valve repairs.\n©ESC 2020\nFigure 3 Management of ventricular septal defect.\nAR = aortic regurgitation; IE = infective endocarditis; LV = left ventricle/ventricular; Qp:Qs = pulmonary to systemic flow ratio; PAH = pulmonary artery\nhypertension; PVR = pulmonary vascular resistance; VSD = ventricular septal defect; WU = Wood units.\naLV enlargement with increased stroke volume.\nbIncludes all patients with desaturation at rest (Eisenmenger physiology) or on exercise.\ncCareful individual decision in expert centres is required.\n596\nESC Guidelines\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/6/563/5898606 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n.............................................................................................................................................................................\n4.3.5\nFollow-up recommendations\nLifelong regular follow-up of all patients with an AVSD, operated and\nunoperated, is recommended, including evaluation in specialized\nACHD centres. Particular attention should be paid to residual shunt,\nAV valve malfunction, LV and RV enlargement and dysfunction, PAP\nelevation, LVOTO, and arrhythmias.164 The frequency of outpatient\nvisits depends on the presence and severity of residual abnormalities.\nA patient with a surgically repaired AVSD without significant residual\nabnormalities should be seen at least every 2\u00023 years. In the case of\nresidual abnormalities, the intervals should be shorter.\nIndications for reoperation for residual abnormalities are compara-\nble with the indications for primary surgery. In operated patients, the\nmost frequently occurring problem is left-sided AV valve regurgita-\ntion.165,166 It has to be emphasized that these valves are different\nfrom mitral valves and more difficult to repair. Left-sided AV valve\nstenosis (most often a result of previous repair) that causes symp-\ntoms should be operated on.\n4.3.6\nAdditional considerations\n• Exercise/sports: for most patients with uncomplicated, repaired\nAVSD, physical activity does not need restriction. Many will,\nhowever, have subnormal exercise performance when measured\nobjectively. Patients with important residual problems require\nindividual recommendations (see section 3.5.5).\n• Pregnancy: well tolerated in patients with complete repair and no\nsignificant residual lesions. An unoperated partial AVSD increases\nthe risk of paradoxical embolization. Patients with pre-capillary\nPH should be counselled against pregnancy. As a rule, patients\nwith residual left-sided AV valve regurgitation, who have no indi-\ncation for surgery, tolerate pregnancy relatively well, although\narrhythmias and worsening of AV valve regurgitation may\noccur167 (see section 3.5.7).\n• IE prophylaxis: recommended only for high-risk patients (see sec-\ntion 3.4.6).\n4.4 Patent ductus arteriosus\n4.4.1\nIntroduction and background\nPatent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is the persistent communication\nbetween the proximal left PA and the descending aorta just distal to\nthe left subclavian artery. It can be associated with a variety of CHD\nlesions, however, in adults, it is usually an isolated finding.\nPDA originally results in L\u0002R shunt and LV and LA volume over-\nload. In moderate and large PDA, PAP is elevated. In patients who\nreach adulthood with a moderate PDA, either LV volume overload\nor PAH may be predominant. Adult patients with a large PDA have,\nin general, developed Eisenmenger physiology.\n4.4.2\nClinical presentation and natural history\nPresentations of adult patients with PDA include:\n• Small duct with no LV volume overload (normal LV) and normal\nPAP (generally asymptomatic).\n• Moderate PDA with predominant LV volume overload: large LV\nwith normal or reduced function (may present with left heart\nfailure).\n• Moderate PDA with predominant PAH: pressure-overloaded RV\n(may present with right heart failure).\n• Large PDA: Eisenmenger physiology with differential hypoxaemia\nand differential cyanosis (lower extremities cyanotic, sometimes\nleft arm too); see sections 3.4.3 and 3.4.8.\nAneurysm formation of the duct is a very rare complication.\nRecommendations for intervention in atrioventricular\nseptal defect\nRecommendations\nClassa\nLevelb\nComplete AVSD\nSurgical repair is not recommended in patients\nwith Eisenmenger physiology, and patients\nwith PAH (PVR >_5 WU) presenting with desa-\nturation on exercise.c\nIII\nC\nFor recommendations on intervention see also recommendations for\nintervention in VSD (section 4.2).\nPartial AVSD (primum ASD)\nSurgical closure is recommended in patients\nwith signiﬁcant RV volume overload and\nshould only be performed by a congenital car-\ndiac surgeon.\nI\nC\nFor further details see recommendations for intervention in\nASD (section 4.1).\nAV valve regurgitation\nValve surgery, preferably AV valve repair, is\nrecommended in symptomatic patients with\nmoderate to severe AV valve regurgitation\nand should be performed by a congenital car-\ndiac surgeon.\nI\nC\nIn asymptomatic patients with severe left-\nsided AV valve regurgitation, valve surgery is\nrecommended when LVESD\n>_45 mmd and/or LVEF <_60% provided other\ncauses of LV dysfunction are excluded.\nI\nC\nIn asymptomatic patients with severe left-\nsided AV valve regurgitation, preserved LV\nfunction (LVESD <45 mmd and/or LVEF\n>60%), high likelihood of successful valve\nrepair, and low surgical risk, intervention\nshould be considered when atrial ﬁbrillation\nor systolic PAP >50 mmHg is present.\nIIa\nC\nLeft ventricular outﬂow tract obstruction\nSee recommendations for intervention in SubAS (section 4.5.3).\nASD = atrial septal defect; AV = atrioventricular; AVSD = atrioventricular septal\ndefect; LV = left ventricle/ventricular; LVEF = left ventricular ejection fraction;\nLVESD = left ventricular end systolic diameter; LVOTO = left ventricular outﬂow\ntract obstruction; PAH = pulmonary artery hypertension; PAP = pulmonary\nartery pressure; PVR = pulmonary vascular resistance; RV = right ventricle/ven-\ntricular; SubAS = subaortic stenosis; VSD = ventricular septal defect; WU =\nWood units.\naClass of recommendation.\nbLevel of evidence.\ncThere are limited data available for a precise cut-off, but by clinical experience,\nthis would be given by a fall of arterial oxygen saturation <90%.\ndCut-off refers to average-sized adults and may require adaption in patients with\nunusually small or large stature.\nESC Guidelines\n597\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/6/563/5898606 by guest on 14 January 2026",

Particular attention should be paid to residual shunt,\nAV valve malfunction, LV and RV enlargement and dysfunction, PAP\nelevation, LVOTO, and arrhythmias.164 The frequency of outpatient\nvisits depends on the presence and severity of residual abnormalities.\nA patient with a surgically repaired AVSD without significant residual\nabnormalities should be seen at least every 2\u00023 years. In the case of\nresidual abnormalities, the intervals should be shorter.\nIndications for reoperation for residual abnormalities are compara-\nble with the indications for primary surgery. In operated patients, the\nmost frequently occurring problem is left-sided AV valve regurgita-\ntion.165,166 It has to be emphasized that these valves are different\nfrom mitral valves and more difficult to repair. Left-sided AV valve\nstenosis (most often a result of previous repair) that causes symp-\ntoms should be operated on.\n4.3.6\nAdditional considerations\n• Exercise/sports: for most patients with uncomplicated, repaired\nAVSD, physical activity does not need restriction. Many will,\nhowever, have subnormal exercise performance when measured\nobjectively. Patients with important residual problems require\nindividual recommendations (see section 3.5.5).\n• Pregnancy: well tolerated in patients with complete repair and no\nsignificant residual lesions. An unoperated partial AVSD increases\nthe risk of paradoxical embolization. Patients with pre-capillary\nPH should be counselled against pregnancy. As a rule, patients\nwith residual left-sided AV valve regurgitation, who have no indi-\ncation for surgery, tolerate pregnancy relatively well, although\narrhythmias and worsening of AV valve regurgitation may\noccur167 (see section 3.5.7).\n• IE prophylaxis: recommended only for high-risk patients (see sec-\ntion 3.4.6).\n4.4 Patent ductus arteriosus\n4.4.1\nIntroduction and background\nPatent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is the persistent communication\nbetween the proximal left PA and the descending aorta just distal to\nthe left subclavian artery. It can be associated with a variety of CHD\nlesions, however, in adults, it is usually an isolated finding.\nPDA originally results in L\u0002R shunt and LV and LA volume over-\nload. In moderate and large PDA, PAP is elevated. In patients who\nreach adulthood with a moderate PDA, either LV volume overload\nor PAH may be predominant.

These genetic\ndefects lead to obstructive arteriopathy of varying severity, which is\nmost pronounced at the sinotubular junction.177\nSupraAS may also be encountered in the setting of familial homo-\nzygous hypercholesterolaemia.178 SupraAS occurs as a localized\nfibrous diaphragm just distal to the coronary ostia or, most com-\nmonly, as an external hourglass deformity with a corresponding lumi-\nnal narrowing of the aorta, or as diffuse stenosis of the ascending\naorta. It may be associated with aortic valve abnormalities, hypoplasia\nof the entire aorta, involvement of coronary ostia, or stenosis of\nmajor branches of the aorta or PAs.\n4.5.2.2 Clinical presentation and natural history\nThe majority of patients present in childhood with symptoms of either\noutflow obstruction or myocardial ischaemia. While progression of\nSupraAS is rare in adulthood, adults remain at risk for cardiac complica-\ntions.179 Sudden death occurs rarely, but it is more common in\nSupraAS with Williams\u0002Beuren syndrome, with diffuse peripheral PA\nstenosis, or with CAD, particularly related to anaesthetic procedures.\n4.5.2.3 Diagnostic work-up\nSee section 3.3 for general principles.\nAuscultation typically reveals a loud systolic ejection murmur best\nheard at the left lower sternal border without associated ejection\nclick or diastolic murmur of AR.\n• Echocardiography enables the anatomic diagnosis of SupraAS\nwhen the acoustic window allows. Doppler echocardiography\nprovides pressure gradients, but these may over- or underesti-\nmate the actual pressure drop across the obstruction. TOE\nallows good visualization of the coronary ostia and 3D TOE can\nbe used for detailed evaluation of the stenotic region.180\n• For exercise testing, see valvular AS (section 4.5.1).\n©ESC 2020\nFigure 5 Management of severe left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.\nAS = aortic stenosis; LVEF = left ventricular ejection fraction; LVOTO = left ventricular outflow tract obstruction; PAP = pulmonary artery pressure; PH\n= pulmonary hypertension; SubAS = subaortic stenosis SupraAS = supravalvular aortic stenosis.\naSee Section 4.5. There are fundamental differences in management decisions compared to valvular AS, particularly because a valve substitute with its con-\nsequences is generally not required.\nbPeak velocity >5.5m/s; severe calcification þ peak velocity progression >_0.3 m/s/y; markedly elevated neurohormones (>3-fold age- and sex-corrected\nnormal range); severe PH (systolic PAP >60 mmHg without other explanation).\nESC Guidelines\n601\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/6/563/5898606 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n.............................................................................................................................................................................\n• CMR/CCT is useful for detailed evaluation of supravalvular anat-\nomy, in particular, when multilevel LVOTO is present or for\n(pre-operative) assessment of coronary artery anatomy and\nother aortic or aortic branch lesions (e.g. carotid and renal artery\nstenosis), and central and branch PAs.\n• Cardiac catheterization: haemodynamic assessment is recom-\nmended when non-invasive quantification remains uncertain.\n• Genetic evaluation, with counselling and subsequent testing using\nmicro-array techniques to diagnose Williams\u0002Beuren syndrome\nand sequencing of the elastin gene in non-syndromic presenta-\ntions, is useful.\n4.5.2.4 Surgical/catheter interventional treatment\nSurgery is the primary treatment: the operative mortality rate for\nfibrous diaphragm and hourglass deformity is <5%. Since the coronary\narteries are under high pressure, surgery might be considered earlier\nthan in patients with valvular AS, particularly when no valve substitute is\nrequired. Following operative repair, the survival rate has been reported\nto be 80\u000285% at 20 years.181 AR may be present in \u000325% of patients,\nbut usually it is not progressive after surgical relief of SupraAS.\n4.5.2.5 Follow-up recommendations\nLifelong and regular follow-up, including echocardiography, is\nrequired to determine progression of obstruction (rare), LV size/\nfunction, and development of symptoms, as well as after surgery to\ndetect late restenosis, development of aneurysm (CMR/CCT), and\nthe occurrence or progression of CAD. Follow-up should include\nevaluation in specialized ACHD centres.\n4.5.2.6 Additional considerations\n• Exercise/sports: see valvular AS (section 4.5.1).\n• Pregnancy: See valvular AS (section 4.5.1). Male and female patients\nwith Williams\u0002Beuren syndrome and elastin gene mutations have\na 50% transmission risk (family screening recommended).\n• IE prophylaxis: recommended only for high-risk patients (see sec-\ntion 3.4.6).\n4.5.3\nSubaortic stenosis\n4.5.3.1 Introduction and background\nSubaortic stenosis (SubAS) occurs as an isolated lesion, but is frequently\nassociated with aortic valve disease, VSD, AVSD, or Shone complex\n(multilevel left heart obstruction). It may also develop after repair of\nthese lesions. It is caused by a fibrous ridge/ring in the LVOT proximal\nto the aortic valve or as a fibromuscular narrowing. SubAS has to be dif-\nferentiated from obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\n4.5.3.2 Clinical presentation and natural history\nThe clinical course is highly variable. The presence of associated\nCHD, particularly a VSD, is related with SubAS progression; age\nseems not to play a role in disease. AR is frequent but rarely haemo-\ndynamically significant or progressive.182 Although infrequent, sudden\ndeath has been reported in SubAS patients.\n4.5.3.3 Diagnostic work-up\nSee section 3.3 for general principles.\nClinical findings mainly include a systolic ejection murmur at the\nleft sternal border without systolic ejection click. A diastolic murmur\nrefers to AR.\n• Echocardiography visualizes LVOT anatomy, associated aortic\nvalve abnormality, degree of AR, LV function, LVH, and associ-\nated lesions. With Doppler echocardiography, the severity of the\nsubvalvular obstruction is determined, but Doppler-derived gra-\ndients may overestimate the obstruction and may require confir-\nmation\nby\ncardiac\ncatheterization.\nOccasionally,\nTOE\nis\nnecessary to better demonstrate the membrane or ring. 3D TOE\ncan be helpful to characterize the complex LVOT anatomy and\nestimate the area of obstruction by planimetry.\n• CMR may be useful to characterize complex LVOTO anatomies,\nespecially in patients with poor acoustic window.\n4.5.3.4 Surgical/catheter interventional treatment\nSurgical treatment is the only effective intervention and involves a\ncomplete resection of the fibrous ridge/ring and parts of the muscular\nbase along the left septal surface. Fibromuscular or tunnel-type\nSubAS requires more extensive resection or a Konno procedure.\nSurgical results are good, but restenosis may occur. In patients with\nlow surgical risk and morphologically well suited to repair, the thresh-\nold for intervention is lower than in aortic valve stenosis since no\nvalve implant is required. In the case of moderate or severe AR, the\naortic valve must be repaired or replaced at the time of surgery.\n4.5.3.5 Follow-up recommendations\nLifelong regular follow-up, including echocardiography, is required in\nthe non-operated state to determine progression of obstruction, AR,\nand LV hypertrophy, function, and size.

It may also develop after repair of\nthese lesions. It is caused by a fibrous ridge/ring in the LVOT proximal\nto the aortic valve or as a fibromuscular narrowing. SubAS has to be dif-\nferentiated from obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\n4.5.3.2 Clinical presentation and natural history\nThe clinical course is highly variable. The presence of associated\nCHD, particularly a VSD, is related with SubAS progression; age\nseems not to play a role in disease. AR is frequent but rarely haemo-\ndynamically significant or progressive.182 Although infrequent, sudden\ndeath has been reported in SubAS patients.\n4.5.3.3 Diagnostic work-up\nSee section 3.3 for general principles.\nClinical findings mainly include a systolic ejection murmur at the\nleft sternal border without systolic ejection click.

It occurs as a discrete stenosis or as a long,\nhypoplastic aortic (arch) segment. Typically, CoA is located in the\narea where the ductus arteriosus inserts, and only in rare cases\noccurs ectopically (ascending, descending, or abdominal aorta).\nAssociated lesions include BAV (up to 85%), ascending aortic\naneurysm, SubAS, or SupraAS, (supra)mitral valve stenosis (including\nparachute mitral valve), Shone complex, or complex congenital heart\ndefects. CoA can be associated with Turner syndrome and\nWilliams\u0002Beuren syndrome. Extracardiac vascular anomalies have\nbeen reported in CoA patients including anomalous origin of the\nright subclavian artery (in 4\u00025% of cases), collateral arterial circula-\ntion, and intracerebral aneurysms (in up to 10%).\n4.6.2\nClinical presentation and natural history\nSigns and symptoms depend on the severity of CoA. Patients with\nsevere CoA usually present with signs and symptoms early in life,\nwhile particularly mild cases may not become evident until adult-\nhood, where CoA is detected in the work-up of arterial\nhypertension.\nKey symptoms may include headache, nosebleeds, dizziness,\ntinnitus, shortness of breath, abdominal angina, claudication, and cold\nfeet.\nPatients with CoA who reach adolescence demonstrate very good\nlong-term survival up to age 60 years. Long-term morbidity is com-\nmon, however, largely related to aortic complications and longstand-\ning hypertension.183\nThe natural course may be complicated by left heart failure, intra-\ncranial haemorrhage (from berry aneurysm), IE, aortic rupture/dis-\nsection, premature coronary and cerebral artery disease, and\nassociated heart defects.\n4.6.3\nDiagnostic work-up\nSee section 3.3 for general principles.\nOffice blood pressure measurement in the upper and lower\nextremities are the primary studies required in all coarctation\npatients. A blood pressure gradient between upper and lower\nextremities (systolic >_20 mmHg) indicates significant CoA. Weak or\nabsent pulses in the lower extremities or radiofemoral pulse delay\nalso indicate significant coarctation.\n• Ambulatory blood pressure measurements (right arm) are rec-\nommended to detect/confirm arterial hypertension (24-h mean\nsystolic >130 mmHg and/or diastolic >80 mmHg).\n• Other findings consist of a suprasternal thrill (proximal obstruc-\ntion), an interscapular (systolic) murmur, or continuous murmurs\n(due to collateral vessels). In the case of a pinpoint CoA, mur-\nmurs may be completely absent.\n• Chest X-ray findings may be characterized by rib notching of the\nthird and fourth (to the eighth) ribs due to the collaterals.\n• Echocardiography provides information regarding site, structure,\nand extent of CoA, LV function and LVH, associated cardiac\nabnormalities, and aortic and supra-aortic vessel diameters.\nDoppler gradients are not useful for quantification, neither in\nnative nor in post-operative coarctation.

An excess of miscar-\nriages and hypertensive disorders has been reported192 (see sec-\ntion 3.5.7).\n• IE prophylaxis: recommended only for high-risk patients (see sec-\ntion 3.4.6).\n4.7 Aortopathies\n4.7.1\nMarfan syndrome and related heritable thoracic\naortic diseases\n4.7.1.1 Introduction and background\nMarfan syndrome is the prototype of syndromic HTAD entities,\ncomprising a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of disor-\nders with aneurysm or dissection of the thoracic aorta as the com-\nmon denominator. Both syndromic and non-syndromic (or isolated)\nforms of HTAD are part of the clinical spectrum, with notable clinical\noverlap between the various entities.\nFor more details on the various syndromes, please refer to the\n2014 ESC Guidelines on aortic disease193 and a consensus document\non genetic testing in ACHD/HTAD.140 Since most children with\nmainly syndromic forms of HTAD will be transferred to ACHD units\nat adult age, these Guidelines focus on specific cardiovascular compli-\ncations. Marfan syndrome is considered as the model disease \u0002\nother syndromes are mentioned in case of important differences\nfrom Marfan syndrome.\n©ESC 2020\nFigure 6 Management of coarctation and re-coarctation of the aorta.\nCoA = coarctation of the aorta.\naRight arm ambulatory blood pressure should be considered for diagnosis.\nbInvasively confirmed measurement.\ncRelative to the aortic diameter at the diaphragm.\nESC Guidelines\n605\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/6/563/5898606 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n.......................................................................................................................................................................\n4.7.1.2 Clinical presentation and natural history\nAlthough thoracic aortic disease \u0002 either aneurysms detected by\nscreening or dissection in an emergency setting \u0002 is the principal\ncharacteristic in Marfan syndrome /HTAD, extra-aortic features in\nthe skeletal/ocular organ system may be the key to diagnosis in some\npatients.\nPrognosis in all HTAD entities is mainly determined by progres-\nsive dilation of the aorta, leading to aortic dissection or rupture.\nPrognosis varies according to the underlying genetic defect. The\naverage age at death in untreated Marfan syndrome patients is\n<40 years, but can approach that of the general population in\npatients in whom the diagnosis is known and who are properly\nmanaged.29,194 More rare cardiovascular causes of death include\nheart failure and SCD.29\nIn Marfan syndrome, the major determinant of type A aortic dis-\nsection is the aortic root diameter with increased risk of rupture >_50\nmm.195 Other risk factors include family history of aortic dissection\nat low diameter,193 aortic root growth rate, pregnancy, and hyper-\ntension. Increasing evidence for gene-based differences in aortic risk\nare emerging and need to be considered. Other parts of the aorta \u0002\nor in the case of some entities, major branching vessels \u0002 may also\ndilate or dissect.\nThe presence of significant aortic, tricuspid, or mitral regurgita-\ntion \u0002 usually related to valve prolapse \u0002 may lead to symptoms\nof ventricular volume overload. However, LV disease may also\noccur independently of valvular dysfunction and this may be asso-\nciated with arrhythmia. Mitral valve prolapse in patients with\nMarfan syndrome manifests early and progresses to severe regur-\ngitation, need for surgery, and IE earlier than idiopathic mitral\nvalve prolapse.196\n4.7.1.3 Diagnostic work-up\nEarly identification and establishment of the correct diagnosis is crit-\nical since prophylactic surgery can prevent aortic dissection and rup-\nture. This requires a multidisciplinary team approach with integration\nof clinical and genetic findings.197 The diagnosis of Marfan syndrome\nis based on the Ghent criteria, with aortic root aneurysm/dissection\nand ectopia lentis as cardinal features.198 Criteria for the other\nHTAD entities are less well defined.\nGene panel testing is meaningful for confirmation of the diagnosis\nand to guide management. Mutation pick-up rate in syndromic forms\nis higher (>90%) than in non-syndromic entities (20\u000230%).199 Once\na pathogenic variant is identified, presymptomatic genetic screening\nof family members is mandatory to allow early and appropriate\nmanagement.\n• Echocardiographic assessment of the aortic root should\ninclude measurements at the annulus, sinus, sinotubular junc-\ntion, distal ascending, arch, and descending thoracic aortic lev-\nels. In adults, measurement at end diastole using the leading-\nto-leading\nedge\nprinciple\nis\nrecommended.\nThe\nvalues\nobtained should be corrected for the individual’s age, sex, and\nbody size using standardized nomograms.200,201 Valvular mor-\nphology (mitral valve prolapse, BAV) and function must be\nassessed, as well as the presence of a PDA. LV dimension and\nfunction\nshould\nbe\naddressed\naccording\nto\nstandard\nrecommendations.\n• CMR or CCT angiography from head to pelvis should be per-\nformed in every patient at baseline, providing imaging of the\nentire aorta and branching vessels. In addition to measuring\naortic diameters, information on aortic/vertebral artery tor-\ntuosity\nis\nimportant\nfor\ndiagnostic\nand\nprognostic\npurposes.202,203\n• Holter monitoring should be performed in symptomatic patients,\nas ventricular arrhythmias, conduction disturbances, and SCD\ncan occur.\n4.7.1.4 Medical therapy\nAlthough no reduction in mortality or dissection rate has been\nestablished in any trial, beta blockers remain the mainstay for\nmedical treatment in Marfan/HTAD patients, reducing wall shear\nstress and aortic growth rate.204 Rigorous antihypertensive medi-\ncal treatment aimed at a 24-h ambulatory systolic blood pressure\n<130 mmHg (110 mmHg in patients with aortic dissection) is\nimportant, although there are no data to establish outright blood\npressure thresholds. ARBs did not prove to have a superior effect\nwhen compared with beta blockers or in addition to beta blockers\nin several trials, but may be considered as an alternative in patients\nintolerant to beta blockers.205,206 Medical treatment should be\ncontinued after surgery.\nOngoing meta-analyses of medical treatment trials may help define\nsubgroups \u0002 based on genetic and clinical data \u0002 who benefit from\nspecific treatment.207 Since no medical trials have been conducted in\nnon-Marfan HTAD, medical treatment is usually adopted from\nMarfan data.\n4.7.1.5 Surgical treatment\nIndications\nfor\nintervention\nare\nsummarized\nin\nthe\nRecommendations for aortic surgery in aortopathies table.\nProphylactic aortic root surgery is the only definitive treatment\nfor the prevention of aortic dissection in Marfan syndrome and\nrelated HTADs. In patients with anatomically normal aortic valves\nand low-grade regurgitation, a valve-sparing aortic root replace-\nment by a Dacron prosthesis and reimplantation of the coronary\narteries into the prosthesis (David procedure) has become the\npreferred surgical procedure with good long-term outcome,\nincluding in Marfan patients.193,208 Composite graft replacement,\nusually with a mechanical valve, is a more durable alternative but\ndoes require lifelong anticoagulation. The decision on which tech-\nnique to use should be made on an individual basis, and patient\npreferences and surgical experience should be taken into\naccount.209\nMarfan and related HTADs are associated with a risk of re-\ndissection and recurrent aneurysm in the distal aorta, especially in\npatients with previous dissection.210,211 With improved life expect-\nancy, these complications now occur more frequently. Open aortic\nsurgery remains the reference method for treatment of distal aortic\ndisease, although hybrid procedures with endovascular stenting \u0002\nwhere proximal and distal landing is possible in a Dacron tube \u0002\ncould be considered in selected cases.\n606\nESC Guidelines\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/6/563/5898606 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n............................................................................................................................................................\n4.7.1.6 Follow-up recommendations\nLifelong and regular multidisciplinary follow-up at an expert centre is\nrequired. Echocardiography and CCT/CMR are the principal\nexaminations.\n4.7.1.7 Additional considerations\n• Exercise/sports: patients should be advised to avoid exertion at\nmaximal capacity, competitive, contact, and isometric sports.\nRisk estimation based on aortic size has been suggested by Budts\net al.24\n• Pregnancy: in genetically confirmed Marfan/HTAD, there is a\n50% transmission risk for both men and women. Proper and\ntimely genetic counselling is needed. Women with an aortic\nroot diameter >45 mm are strongly discouraged from becom-\ning pregnant without prior repair because of the increased risk\nof dissection.43 An aortic root diameter <40 mm rarely\npresents a problem, although a completely safe diameter does\nnot exist. With an aortic root 40\u000245 mm, previous aortic\ngrowth and family history are important factors when consid-\nering repair prior to pregnancy. After repair of the ascending\naorta, Marfan patients remain at risk for dissection of the\nresidual aorta (see section 3.5.7).\n• IE prophylaxis: recommended only for high-risk patients (see sec-\ntion 3.4.6).\n4.7.2\nBicuspid aortic disease\nDepending on the reported series, 20\u000284% of patients with a BAV\nwill develop ascending aortic dilatation,212 indicating that BAV should\nbe regarded as part of a spectrum of valvluo-aortopathy and that\nbicuspid aortic disease may be a more appropriate term. Although\nthe relative contribution of intrinsic/genetic wall abnormalities and\naltered haemodynamics remains debated, both factors are probably\ninvolved.\nIn the absence of significant valvular dysfunction, aortic\ndilatation in the setting of bicuspid aortic disease typically evolves\nasymptomatically. With increasing diameters, however, the\nrisk for acute aortic dissection rises. Compared with the general\npopulation,\nthe\ndissection\nincidence\nin\nbicuspid\naortic\ndisease patients is eight times higher, which is in absolute num-\nbers still a low risk (31/100 000 patient years)172,176,213 and much\nlower than in Marfan/HTAD. Observational studies indicate that\nthe clinical outcome in bicuspid aortic disease patients is\nmore similar to that of the general population with aneurysms\nand\nrepresents\na\nmore\nbenign\naortopathy\nthan\nMarfan/\nHTAD.176,214\nCoA is associated with an increased risk for dissection.215\nFor diagnostic work-up see section 4.7.1.3.\nTo this date, no evidence for medical treatment of aortic dilatation\nin the setting of bicuspid aortic disease is available, but it may be\nreasonable to consider beta blockers or ARBs as first-line treatment\nfor arterial hypertension.\nIndications\nfor\nintervention\nare\nsummarized\nin\nthe\nRecommendations for aortic surgery in aortopathies table.\nFamilial occurrence of BAV has clearly been established with\nrates of 5\u000210% in first-degree relatives in various studies.216\nEchocardiographic screening in first-degree relatives of BAV\npatients\nis\nrecommended\nand\nmay\nbe\nappropriate,\nparticularly in boys, in athletes, and if hypertension is present.\nRare pathogenic variants in a number of genes account for <5%\nof all bicuspid aortic disease cases and routine genetic testing in\nthis setting is not indicated but may be considered in familial\ncases.140\nThere are no data on the risk for dissection related to pregnancy\nin women with a dilated aorta. According to the 2018 ESC\nGuidelines for the management of cardiovascular disease during\npregnancy,43 women should be counselled against pregnancy when\nthe aortic diameter is >50 mm.\nFor treatment of AR, see 2017 ESC/EACTS Guidelines on the\nmanagement of valvular heart disease.25\n4.7.3\nTurner syndrome\nTurner syndrome is caused by a partial or complete monosomy of\nthe X-chromosome and occurs in 1 in 2500 live-born females.217\nTurner syndrome is associated with short stature, delayed pub-\nerty, ovarian dysgenesis, hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, infer-\ntility, congenital malformations of the heart, diabetes mellitus,\nosteoporosis, and autoimmune disorders. CHD, occurring in\napproximately 50% of women with Turner syndrome, includes a\nhigh incidence of BAV, CoA, partial anomalous pulmonary venous\nconnection, left SVC, elongated transverse aortic arch, dilatation\nof the brachiocephalic arteries, and aortic dilatation. Given this\nhigh prevalence of abnormalities, every woman with Turner syn-\ndrome should be seen by a cardiologist at least once.217 Even in\nthe absence of CHD, all individuals with Turner syndrome have a\ngeneralized arteriopathy and Turner syndrome alone is an inde-\npendent risk factor for thoracic aortic dilation. Aortic dissection\n(both type A and type B) occurs in approximately 40 per 100 000\nperson-years compared with 6 per 100 000 person-years in the\ngeneral population.218\nFor diagnostic work-up see section 4.7.1.3.\nIndications\nfor\nintervention\nare\nsummarized\nin\nthe\nRecommendations for aortic surgery in aortopathies table.\nWith advances in assisted reproductive technology and oocyte\ndonation, an increasing number of women with Turner syndrome\nare now able to become pregnant. The presence of aortic dilatation\nand CHD increases the risks of pregnancy and Turner syndrome\nwomen are also at increased risk of hypertensive disorders, including\npre-eclampsia. All women with Turner syndrome should be coun-\nselled about the increased cardiovascular risk of pregnancy and fertil-\nity treatment.43\nESC Guidelines\n607\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/6/563/5898606 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n.............................................................................................................................................................................\n4.8 Right ventricular outflow tract\nobstruction\n4.8.1\nIntroduction and background\nRVOTO can occur at the sub-infundibular, infundibular, valvular, or\nsupravalvular levels.\n• Sub-infundibular stenosis, or DCRV, is commonly associated\nwith a VSD. It is caused by narrowing between prominent and\nhypertrophied muscle bands or ridges that separate the hyper-\ntrophied, high-pressure inlet and apical portions from a low-\npressure, non-hypertrophied and non-obstructive infundibular\nportion of the RV.219\n• Infundibular stenosis usually occurs in combination with other\nlesions, particularly VSD, TOF, and secondary to valvular pulmo-\nnary stenosis (PS) (reactive myocardial hypertrophy). At the\ninfundibular level, and to some extent the sub-infundibular level,\nthe obstruction tends to be dynamic, meaning that the orifice\nnarrows during systole.\n• Valvular PS is usually an isolated lesion. Mainly due to intrinsic\nwall abnormalities, and independent of haemodynamics, dilation\nof the PA may occur. Most often, there is a typical dome-shaped\npulmonary valve with a narrow central opening but a preserved\nmobile valve base. A dysplastic pulmonary valve, with poorly\nmobile cusps and myxomatous thickening, is less common\n(15\u000220%; even less in untreated adults) and frequently part of\nNoonan syndrome. In adults, a stenotic pulmonary valve may cal-\ncify late in life.\n• Supravalvular PS, or pulmonary arterial stenosis, is caused by\nnarrowing of the main pulmonary trunk, pulmonary arterial\nbifurcation, or pulmonary branches. It seldom occurs in isola-\ntion, and may occur in Williams\u0002Beuren syndrome, Noonan\nsyndrome, congenital rubella syndrome, or Alagille syndrome.\nThe stenosis may be located in the main branches or more\nperipherally; it may be discrete or diffuse (hypoplastic) or\nthere may be frank occlusion, and it may occur as single or\nmultiple stenoses. Stenosis may be secondary to previous\nplacement of a PA band or at a previous shunt site. A diameter\nnarrowing >_50% is usually considered to be significant and\nwould be expected to have a pressure gradient and result in\nhypertension in the proximal PA.\n4.8.2\nClinical presentation and natural history\n• Sub-infundibular/infundibular: adult patients with DCRV may be\nasymptomatic or they may present with dyspnoea, chest discom-\nfort, dizziness, or syncope during exertion. The degree of\nobstruction is progressive over time.220\n• Valvular: patients with mild-to-moderate valvular PS are usually\nasymptomatic. Mild valvular PS in unoperated adults is usually not\nprogressive.221 Moderate PS can progress at the valvular level (cal-\ncification) or at the subvalvular level due to reactive myocardial\nhypertrophy. Patients with severe stenosis may present with dysp-\nnoea and reduced exercise capacity and have a worse prognosis.\n• Supravalvular: patients may be asymptomatic or have symptoms of\ndyspnoea and reduced exercise capacity.

It is caused by narrowing between prominent and\nhypertrophied muscle bands or ridges that separate the hyper-\ntrophied, high-pressure inlet and apical portions from a low-\npressure, non-hypertrophied and non-obstructive infundibular\nportion of the RV.219\n• Infundibular stenosis usually occurs in combination with other\nlesions, particularly VSD, TOF, and secondary to valvular pulmo-\nnary stenosis (PS) (reactive myocardial hypertrophy). At the\ninfundibular level, and to some extent the sub-infundibular level,\nthe obstruction tends to be dynamic, meaning that the orifice\nnarrows during systole.\n• Valvular PS is usually an isolated lesion. Mainly due to intrinsic\nwall abnormalities, and independent of haemodynamics, dilation\nof the PA may occur. Most often, there is a typical dome-shaped\npulmonary valve with a narrow central opening but a preserved\nmobile valve base. A dysplastic pulmonary valve, with poorly\nmobile cusps and myxomatous thickening, is less common\n(15\u000220%; even less in untreated adults) and frequently part of\nNoonan syndrome. In adults, a stenotic pulmonary valve may cal-\ncify late in life.\n• Supravalvular PS, or pulmonary arterial stenosis, is caused by\nnarrowing of the main pulmonary trunk, pulmonary arterial\nbifurcation, or pulmonary branches. It seldom occurs in isola-\ntion, and may occur in Williams\u0002Beuren syndrome, Noonan\nsyndrome, congenital rubella syndrome, or Alagille syndrome.\nThe stenosis may be located in the main branches or more\nperipherally; it may be discrete or diffuse (hypoplastic) or\nthere may be frank occlusion, and it may occur as single or\nmultiple stenoses. Stenosis may be secondary to previous\nplacement of a PA band or at a previous shunt site. A diameter\nnarrowing >_50% is usually considered to be significant and\nwould be expected to have a pressure gradient and result in\nhypertension in the proximal PA.\n4.8.2\nClinical presentation and natural history\n• Sub-infundibular/infundibular: adult patients with DCRV may be\nasymptomatic or they may present with dyspnoea, chest discom-\nfort, dizziness, or syncope during exertion. The degree of\nobstruction is progressive over time.220\n• Valvular: patients with mild-to-moderate valvular PS are usually\nasymptomatic. Mild valvular PS in unoperated adults is usually not\nprogressive.221 Moderate PS can progress at the valvular level (cal-\ncification) or at the subvalvular level due to reactive myocardial\nhypertrophy. Patients with severe stenosis may present with dysp-\nnoea and reduced exercise capacity and have a worse prognosis.\n• Supravalvular: patients may be asymptomatic or have symptoms of\ndyspnoea and reduced exercise capacity. They are usually recog-\nnized in the context of certain syndromes or in patients referred for\nsuspicion of PH.

It is caused by narrowing between prominent and\nhypertrophied muscle bands or ridges that separate the hyper-\ntrophied, high-pressure inlet and apical portions from a low-\npressure, non-hypertrophied and non-obstructive infundibular\nportion of the RV.219\n• Infundibular stenosis usually occurs in combination with other\nlesions, particularly VSD, TOF, and secondary to valvular pulmo-\nnary stenosis (PS) (reactive myocardial hypertrophy). At the\ninfundibular level, and to some extent the sub-infundibular level,\nthe obstruction tends to be dynamic, meaning that the orifice\nnarrows during systole.\n• Valvular PS is usually an isolated lesion. Mainly due to intrinsic\nwall abnormalities, and independent of haemodynamics, dilation\nof the PA may occur. Most often, there is a typical dome-shaped\npulmonary valve with a narrow central opening but a preserved\nmobile valve base. A dysplastic pulmonary valve, with poorly\nmobile cusps and myxomatous thickening, is less common\n(15\u000220%; even less in untreated adults) and frequently part of\nNoonan syndrome. In adults, a stenotic pulmonary valve may cal-\ncify late in life.\n• Supravalvular PS, or pulmonary arterial stenosis, is caused by\nnarrowing of the main pulmonary trunk, pulmonary arterial\nbifurcation, or pulmonary branches. It seldom occurs in isola-\ntion, and may occur in Williams\u0002Beuren syndrome, Noonan\nsyndrome, congenital rubella syndrome, or Alagille syndrome.\nThe stenosis may be located in the main branches or more\nperipherally; it may be discrete or diffuse (hypoplastic) or\nthere may be frank occlusion, and it may occur as single or\nmultiple stenoses. Stenosis may be secondary to previous\nplacement of a PA band or at a previous shunt site. A diameter\nnarrowing >_50% is usually considered to be significant and\nwould be expected to have a pressure gradient and result in\nhypertension in the proximal PA.\n4.8.2\nClinical presentation and natural history\n• Sub-infundibular/infundibular: adult patients with DCRV may be\nasymptomatic or they may present with dyspnoea, chest discom-\nfort, dizziness, or syncope during exertion. The degree of\nobstruction is progressive over time.220\n• Valvular: patients with mild-to-moderate valvular PS are usually\nasymptomatic. Mild valvular PS in unoperated adults is usually not\nprogressive.221 Moderate PS can progress at the valvular level (cal-\ncification) or at the subvalvular level due to reactive myocardial\nhypertrophy. Patients with severe stenosis may present with dysp-\nnoea and reduced exercise capacity and have a worse prognosis.\n• Supravalvular: patients may be asymptomatic or have symptoms of\ndyspnoea and reduced exercise capacity. They are usually recog-\nnized in the context of certain syndromes or in patients referred for\nsuspicion of PH.

In periph-\neral PS, the systolic murmur is typically heard over the lung fields.\n• Echocardiography: size, shape, and function of the RV can be\nassessed and the exact position/level of the RVOTO can be\nvisualized, as well as pulmonary valve, main PA, and proximal PA\nbranches. For quantification of RV sizes, volumes, and EF, CMR is\na more robust and more reliable technique. Doppler ultrasound\nis used for measurements of flow velocities across an obstruction\nto assess severity. Correlation between flow velocities and pres-\nsure gradients is only good in the case of discrete stenosis, e.g.\nisolated valvular PS. In the presence of normal RV function and\nnormal transvalvular flow, RVOTO is considered mild when the\npeak gradient across the obstruction is <36 mmHg, moderate if\n36\u000264 mmHg, and severe when the gradient is >64 mmHg. If\nthe narrowing is elongated, or if more than one stenosis is\npresent in series (e.g. subvalvular and valvular), application of the\nBernoulli equation will lead to an overestimation of the pressure\ngradient. Doppler flow velocity of TR then gives a more reliable\nestimation of RV pressures \u0002 and with that, severity of the\nRVOTO \u0002 than the flow velocity across the RVOTO. Gradients\nonly represent severity of an obstruction if a good systolic RV\nfunction is present. In a low-flow, low-gradient situation, it is very\ndifficult to assess severity of a RVOTO.222\n• CMR and CCT frequently provide additional important informa-\ntion identifying the level(s) of obstruction, including at the sub-\ninfundibular (DCRV), conduit, or branch PA levels, and assess-\nment of RV volumes, pulmonary annulus, outflow tract and\nartery dimensions, and differential pulmonary blood flow. CMR\nand CCT are the methods of choice for visualization of pulmo-\nnary dilation and peripheral PS.\n• Cardiac catheterization may be required to confirm the extent,\nseverity, and level of obstruction (e.g. DCRV).\n4.8.4\nSurgical/catheter interventional treatment\nCatheter-based balloon valvotomy is recommended for patients\nwith non-dysplastic valvular PS and with peripheral PS (often with\nstent implantation).223 Surgery is recommended for patients with\nsub-infundibular or infundibular PS and hypoplastic pulmonary annu-\nlus, with dysplastic pulmonary valves, and for patients with associated\nlesions which need a surgical approach, such as severe pulmonary\nregurgitation (PR) or severe TR.

Doppler ultrasound\nis used for measurements of flow velocities across an obstruction\nto assess severity. Correlation between flow velocities and pres-\nsure gradients is only good in the case of discrete stenosis, e.g.\nisolated valvular PS. In the presence of normal RV function and\nnormal transvalvular flow, RVOTO is considered mild when the\npeak gradient across the obstruction is <36 mmHg, moderate if\n36\u000264 mmHg, and severe when the gradient is >64 mmHg. If\nthe narrowing is elongated, or if more than one stenosis is\npresent in series (e.g. subvalvular and valvular), application of the\nBernoulli equation will lead to an overestimation of the pressure\ngradient. Doppler flow velocity of TR then gives a more reliable\nestimation of RV pressures \u0002 and with that, severity of the\nRVOTO \u0002 than the flow velocity across the RVOTO.

In periph-\neral PS, the systolic murmur is typically heard over the lung fields.\n• Echocardiography: size, shape, and function of the RV can be\nassessed and the exact position/level of the RVOTO can be\nvisualized, as well as pulmonary valve, main PA, and proximal PA\nbranches. For quantification of RV sizes, volumes, and EF, CMR is\na more robust and more reliable technique. Doppler ultrasound\nis used for measurements of flow velocities across an obstruction\nto assess severity. Correlation between flow velocities and pres-\nsure gradients is only good in the case of discrete stenosis, e.g.\nisolated valvular PS. In the presence of normal RV function and\nnormal transvalvular flow, RVOTO is considered mild when the\npeak gradient across the obstruction is <36 mmHg, moderate if\n36\u000264 mmHg, and severe when the gradient is >64 mmHg. If\nthe narrowing is elongated, or if more than one stenosis is\npresent in series (e.g. subvalvular and valvular), application of the\nBernoulli equation will lead to an overestimation of the pressure\ngradient. Doppler flow velocity of TR then gives a more reliable\nestimation of RV pressures \u0002 and with that, severity of the\nRVOTO \u0002 than the flow velocity across the RVOTO. Gradients\nonly represent severity of an obstruction if a good systolic RV\nfunction is present. In a low-flow, low-gradient situation, it is very\ndifficult to assess severity of a RVOTO.222\n• CMR and CCT frequently provide additional important informa-\ntion identifying the level(s) of obstruction, including at the sub-\ninfundibular (DCRV), conduit, or branch PA levels, and assess-\nment of RV volumes, pulmonary annulus, outflow tract and\nartery dimensions, and differential pulmonary blood flow. CMR\nand CCT are the methods of choice for visualization of pulmo-\nnary dilation and peripheral PS.\n• Cardiac catheterization may be required to confirm the extent,\nseverity, and level of obstruction (e.g. DCRV).\n4.8.4\nSurgical/catheter interventional treatment\nCatheter-based balloon valvotomy is recommended for patients\nwith non-dysplastic valvular PS and with peripheral PS (often with\nstent implantation).223 Surgery is recommended for patients with\nsub-infundibular or infundibular PS and hypoplastic pulmonary annu-\nlus, with dysplastic pulmonary valves, and for patients with associated\nlesions which need a surgical approach, such as severe pulmonary\nregurgitation (PR) or severe TR. Peripheral PS can rarely be\naddressed with surgery.\nBoth surgical and catheter interventions should only be performed\nin centres specialized in CHD.\nIn patients with subvalvular, valvular, and supravalvular PS, a mark-\nedly dilated pulmonary trunk may be present. Rupture is extremely\nrare in these low-pressure, highly elastic vessels and these pulmonary\naneurysms generally do not require intervention.224\nFor RV\u0002PA conduit, see section 4.14.\nIndications\nfor\nintervention\nare\nsummarized\nin\nthe\nRecommendations for intervention in right ventricular outflow tract obstruc-\ntion table and in Figure 7.\n4.8.5\nFollow-up recommendations\nPatients with RVOTO need lifelong follow-up with regular echocar-\ndiographic imaging. The frequency of follow-up depends on the\nseverity of the lesion, but most patients will need a yearly visit, includ-\ning evaluation in specialized ACHD centres except for patients with\nmild or well repaired valvular stenosis. After surgical or catheter\nintervention, a residual PR may need reintervention later in life for\npatients who become symptomatic or when progressive RV dilata-\ntion or dysfunction occurs (see section 4.10). Patients with mild valvu-\nlar or mild residual PS need to be seen only once in 5 years.\n4.8.6\nAdditional considerations\n• Exercise/sports: no restrictions for patients with mild (residual)\nPS.

Patients with severe PS should be restricted to low-\nintensity sports.\n• Pregnancy: well tolerated unless the RVOTO is extremely severe\nor unless RV failure is a major issue. Transcatheter balloon val-\nvotomy can be performed during pregnancy but is rarely neces-\nsary (see section 3.5.7).\n• IE prophylaxis: recommended only for high-risk patients (see sec-\ntion 3.4.6).\n4.9 Ebstein anomaly\n4.9.1\nIntroduction and background\nEbstein anomaly is characterized by abnormally formed and apically\ndisplaced leaflets of the TV. The anterior leaflet usually originates at\nthe annular level but is enlarged and sail-like, while the septal and pos-\nterior leaflets are displaced towards the RV apex and often tethered\nto the endocardium.\nThe apical displacement of the TV means that the right heart con-\nsists of a morphological RA, an atrialized portion of the RV, and the\nremaining functional RV; the TV is often regurgitant.\nThe most frequently associated anomalies include a shunt at the\natrial level [secundum ASD or patent foramen ovale (PFO)] and\n(concealed) accessory pathways, including Mahaim-type pathways.\nMultiple accessory pathways in conjunction with AT and AF are asso-\nciated with SCD. Ebstein-like anomaly of the systemic TV is present\nin one-third of ccTGA.\nHaemodynamic changes depend on the severity of the TV dysfunc-\ntion, the degree of atrialization of the RV, contractility of the remain-\ning functional RV and the systemic ventricle, type and severity of\nconcomitant anomalies, and arrhythmias.\nThe pathophysiology is characterized by systolic regurgitation\nof blood from the functional RV, across the TV, and into the\natrialized ventricle or RA, which tend to dilate. An interatrial connec-\ntion permits a L\u0002R shunt or, especially during exercise, a R\u0002L shunt.\nEbstein anomaly may result in a chronically low systemic cardiac\noutput.\n4.9.2\nClinical presentation and natural history\nThe clinical presentation ranges from trivial symptoms to the presen-\ntation of a profound cyanotic heart defect. Patients with mild forms\ncan be asymptomatic over decades until they are diagnosed. Typical\ncomplications include high-grade TR, RV dysfunction, RV failure, liver\ncirrhosis, cerebral abscesses, paradoxical embolism, pulmonary\nembolism, tachyarrhythmias, SCD, and IE. Key symptoms are\narrhythmias [atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) is most\n©ESC 2020\nFigure 7 Management of right ventricular outflow tract obstruction.\nASD = atrial septal defect; PS = pulmonary stenosis; R\u0002L = right-to-left; RV = right ventricle/ventricular; RVOTO = right ventricular outflow tract\nobstruction; RVSP = right ventricular systolic pressure; TR = tricuspid regurgitation; VSD = ventricular septal defect.\naIn peripheral PS, regardless of symptoms, catheter interventional treatment should be considered if >50% diameter narrowing and RVSP >50 mmHg and/\nor related reduced lung perfusion is present.\nbIn valvular PS, balloon valvuloplasty is the intervention of choice if anatomically suitable.\n610\nESC Guidelines\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/6/563/5898606 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n.......................................\ncommon], dyspnoea, fatigue, poor exercise tolerance, chest pain, and\nperipheral and/or central cyanosis.\n4.9.3\nDiagnostic work-up\nSee section 3.3 for general principles.\nClinical\nfindings\nmay\ninclude\ncyanosis\nand\nhepatomegaly.\nAuscultation findings include a widely split first sound and second\nsound, serial clicks, third and fourth sound, and a systolic murmur\nfrom TR. ECG may show RA hypertrophy, a prolonged PR\ninterval, right bundle branch block (often with a splintered QRS com-\nplex), deep Q in II, III, aVF, and V1\u0002V4, pre-excitation, low voltage,\nmultiple pathways (AVRT), and supraventricular and ventricular\narrhythmias.\n• Chest X-ray is helpful to follow changes in the heart’s size.\n• Echocardiography provides information on: anatomy and func-\ntion of the TV; apical distal displacement of the septal or poste-\nrior leaflet (in adults >_0.8 cm/m2 BSA); size of the anterior leaflet;\ntethering of the septal or posterior TV leaflet on the septum or\nventricular wall; size and function of the different cardiac sections\n(RA, atrialized ventricle, remaining functional RV, and LV); and\nRVOTO and associated lesions.\n• CMR has value with regards to prognostication225, and for evalu-\nation before and after surgery, as it offers unrestricted views for\nassessment and quantification of the dilated right heart, RV func-\ntion, and TV function.\n4.9.4\nSurgical/catheter interventional treatment\nClinical symptoms determine the treatment. Conservative therapy can\nalleviate symptoms temporarily and create a beneficial basis for the fol-\nlowing operation.226 Oral anticoagulation is recommended for patients\nwith a history of paradoxical embolism or AF. In the presence of an\nincreased thromboembolic risk or a R\u0002L shunt, oral anticoagulation\nmay be considered. Symptomatic rhythm disorders can be treated\nconservatively or, preferably, with EP intervention.227 Transcatheter\naccess to right-sided accessory pathways and the slow pathway in AV\nnode reentry may be hindered by TV surgery, such that it may be rea-\nsonable to assess for arrhythmia substrates and proceed with catheter\nablation, if identified, before surgery. Occasionally, there may be an\nindication to close the atrial communication in isolation. However, this\nneeds to be discussed carefully, as it may lead to a further increase in\nright heart pressures and a decrease in systemic cardiac output.\nSurgical repair remains challenging and should only be performed by\nsurgeons with specific experience in this lesion. TV repair, if feasible, is\npreferred over TV replacement (with closure of an associated intera-\ntrial communication). If the RV is too small for repair or RV dysfunction\nhas developed, an additional bidirectional cavopulmonary (Glenn)\nanastomosis may be considered in adults with preserved LV function\nwhen LA pressure and LV end diastolic pressure are not elevated.228\nIn patients with failed repair, or in severe biventricular dysfunction,\nheart transplantation may be the only option.\nThe previously high operative mortality (>25%) has fallen to <6%\nin specialized centres. Over 90% of patients operated on by an expe-\nrienced surgeon survive >10 years, many in functional class I or II.\nLate fatalities are probably due to arrhythmias.

ECG may show RA hypertrophy, a prolonged PR\ninterval, right bundle branch block (often with a splintered QRS com-\nplex), deep Q in II, III, aVF, and V1\u0002V4, pre-excitation, low voltage,\nmultiple pathways (AVRT), and supraventricular and ventricular\narrhythmias.\n• Chest X-ray is helpful to follow changes in the heart’s size.\n• Echocardiography provides information on: anatomy and func-\ntion of the TV; apical distal displacement of the septal or poste-\nrior leaflet (in adults >_0.8 cm/m2 BSA); size of the anterior leaflet;\ntethering of the septal or posterior TV leaflet on the septum or\nventricular wall; size and function of the different cardiac sections\n(RA, atrialized ventricle, remaining functional RV, and LV); and\nRVOTO and associated lesions.\n• CMR has value with regards to prognostication225, and for evalu-\nation before and after surgery, as it offers unrestricted views for\nassessment and quantification of the dilated right heart, RV func-\ntion, and TV function.\n4.9.4\nSurgical/catheter interventional treatment\nClinical symptoms determine the treatment.

Symptomatic rhythm disorders can be treated\nconservatively or, preferably, with EP intervention.227 Transcatheter\naccess to right-sided accessory pathways and the slow pathway in AV\nnode reentry may be hindered by TV surgery, such that it may be rea-\nsonable to assess for arrhythmia substrates and proceed with catheter\nablation, if identified, before surgery.

Patients with more than mild TR, ventricular dysfunction,\nshunting, arrhythmias, or other complications should avoid heavy\nisometric exercises, in proportion to the severity of their problems.\n• Pregnancy: asymptomatic females with good ventricular function\nmay tolerate pregnancy well. There is a certain risk of RV failure,\narrhythmia, and paradoxical embolism. Pregnancy will be of\nhigher risk in the presence of significant cyanosis, serious arrhyth-\nmia, and right heart failure (see section 3.5.7).\n• IE prophylaxis: recommended only for high-risk patients (see sec-\ntion 3.4.6).\n4.10 Tetralogy of Fallot\n4.10.1\nIntroduction and background\nTOF is characterized by the following four features: a non-\nrestrictive VSD; overriding aorta (but <50%); infundibular, valvu-\nlar, supravalvular RVOTO and/or branch PA stenosis; and conse-\nquent RV hypertrophy (RVH). TOF populations can be subdivided\ninto syndromic patients (\u000320%, such as: microdeletion 22q11,\ntrisomy 21, Alagille, Noonan, Williams, and Klippel Feil) and non-\nsyndromic patients (which represent the vast majority).230 The\nstandardized mortality rate among patients with repaired TOF is\nalmost twice as high as among patients with simple defects (ASD\nand VSD).231\n4.10.2\nClinical presentation and natural history\nSurgical repair of TOF has evolved over time, with relief of the\nRVOTO usually involving infundibulotomy, resection of obstructive\nmuscle bundles, and the use of a patch to enlarge the pathway from\nthe RV to the PAs. In some patients, a palliative shunt procedure \u0002 in\norder to increase pulmonary blood flow \u0002 has been performed\nbefore repair. Common complications in adulthood are:\n• PR: significant PR is almost always encountered following a transan-\nnular patch repair. PR is usually well tolerated for years. Severe\nchronic PR, however, eventually leads to symptomatic RV dilation\nand dysfunction.232 The severity of PR and its deleterious long-term\neffects are augmented by co-existing distal PA stenoses or PAH.\n• Residual RVOTO can occur at the infundibulum, at the level of the\npulmonary valve and main pulmonary trunk, and into the branches\nof the left and right PA. Elevated RV pressure and RVH have been\ndescribed as independent risk factors for poor outcome and a\ndecreased exercise performance, despite smaller RV volumes233.\n• Residual VSD can be due to partial patch dehiscence or failure of\ncomplete closure at the time of surgery; it may lead to LV volume\noverload.\n• Aortic complications may occur many years after the initial surgi-\ncal repair and include progressive aortic dilation and AR (rarely\naortic dissection). The underlying mechanism is incompletely\nunderstood, and may include ascending aorta dilation, abnormal\naortic elasticity, or type of surgical repair234.\n• RV and LV dysfunction/heart failure: RV dilation is usually due to\nresidual longstanding free PR ± RVOTO. Significant TR may\noccur as a consequence of RV dilation, which begets more RV\ndilation. LV dilatation may result from longstanding palliative arte-\nrial shunts, residual VSDs, and/or AR. Both RV and LV dysfunc-\ntion may be due to longstanding cyanosis before repair and/or\ninadequate\nmyocardial\nprotection\nduring\nrepair,\nadverse\nventricular\u0002ventricular interactions, electromechanical dyssyn-\nchrony,235,236 and coronary artery abnormalities. A reduced LV\nfree wall longitudinal strain has been reported despite preserved\nLVEF.237 The incidence of clinical heart failure, with its typical\nsigns\nand\nsymptoms,\nincreases\nsignificantly\nwith\nage.238\nUnderlying mechanisms may also be: damage to myocardium,\nsequelae from surgical repair strategies, or electrical conduction\nabnormalities. Management strategies effective in acquired heart\ndisease are frequently applied in these patients, although its effec-\ntiveness for RV failure remains uncertain.239\n• Atrial/ventricular arrhythmias and SCD: arrhythmias and sud-\nden death are important late complications. The estimated\nlifetime prevalence of atrial arrhythmias is 20%. IART involving\nthe cavotricuspid isthmus and RA incision are related to RA\nenlargement, whereas AF is facilitated by LA dilatation.\nVentricular arrythmias encompass polymorphic VT/VF, typi-\ncally related to severely impaired RV and LV function, and\nmonomorphic sustained VT, which are particularly relevant in\nrTOF.34 Although both polymorphic VT/VF and monomor-\nphic VT can lead to SCD, with a reported frequency of\n1\u00023.5% in retrospective studies,32 the different underlying\nventricular arrhythmia substrates need to be recognized for\nrisk stratification and treatment. LV systolic or diastolic dys-\nfunction, and ventricular and atrial tachyarrhythmias are pre-\ndictive of death and sustained VT in adults with rTOF.240\nPossible risk factors associated with any ventricular arrhyth-\nmia and SCD in rTOF are QRS duration >_180 ms, LV systolic\nor diastolic dysfunction, and inducible VT at EP testing. Older\nage at PVRep and pre-PVRep RVH and dysfunction may be\npredictive of shorter time to post-operative death and sus-\ntained ventricular arrhythmia.241 The dominant substrates for\nmonomorphic VT are anatomically defined isthmuses, bor-\ndered by unexcitable tissue. Isthmus dimension and conduc-\ntion properties can be evaluated by catheter mapping and\nlikely determine susceptibility to arrhythmias. Targeting the\nanatomical isthmuses by catheter ablation has been highly\neffective to control VT.242 Whether catheter mapping can\ncontribute to individualized risk stratification requires further\ninvestigation.\n• Endocarditis can be encountered after both surgical and per-\ncutaneous PVRep. Valve-containing prosthetics are an impor-\ntant independent risk factor for IE in the short- and long-term\nafter implantation, whereas non-valve-containing prosthetics\nare a risk factor only during the first 6 months after\nimplantation.76\nA schematic overview of long-term complications after repair of\nTOF is provided in Figure 8.\n4.10.3\nDiagnostic work-up of repaired patients\nSee section 3.3 for general principles.\n• Clinical findings mostly include a wide split in the second heart\nsound. A low-pitched early ending diastolic murmur suggests\nsevere PR. A long, loud ejection systolic murmur indicates\nRVOTO, a high-pitched diastolic murmur indicates AR, and a\npansystolic murmur indicates a residual VSD.\n612\nESC Guidelines\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/6/563/5898606 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n..............................................................................\n• ECG often shows complete right bundle branch block dependent\non the surgical approach. The QRS width may also be influenced\nby the degree of RV dilation.\n• Echocardiography provides assessment of residual RVOTO and\nPR, residual VSD, RV and LV size and function,241 TR, RV pres-\nsure, aortic root size, and AR. Strain measurements are helpful in\nquantifying the degree of electromechanical dyssychrony.243\n• CMR is the method of choice for assessment of RV volume and\nfunction; PR; size, shape, and expansion of the PAs; infundibulum;\nthe ascending aorta; the position of great vessels or conduits in\nrelation to the sternum (resternotomy); and evaluation for resid-\nual shunt (Qp:Qs). Late gadolinium enhancement demonstrates\nfibrosis, the extent of which relates to other risk factors for VT\nand SCD.244 T1 mapping may have an emerging role.\n• CCT provides information on coronary arteries (particularly impor-\ntant for the assessment of the spatial relationship with the RVOT\nprior to TPVI or surgery), the extent of conduit calcification (percu-\ntaneous valve anchoring), and the presence of major aortic pulmo-\nnary collaterals (MAPCAs). CCT may also be considered as an\nalternative for RV quantification in patients unable to undergo CMR.\n• CPET assists timing of reintervention and provides prognostic\ninformation.23\n• Holter monitoring, event recorder, and EP evaluation are\nrequired for selected patients (high risk, suspected or clinical\narrhythmia, and/or before RVOT reoperation). Inducible sus-\ntained VT carries prognostic value for clinical VT and SCD.245\n• Cardiac catheterization should be restricted to patients under-\ngoing catheter-based interventions (i.e. relief of distal PA stenosis,\ntranscatheter valve implantation) and when non-invasive evalua-\ntion is inconclusive. Before surgery, coronary angiography may\nvisualize the coronary arteries, which is important to assess the\nspatial relationship with the RVOT prior to TPVI.\n4.10.4\nLate surgical/catheter interventional treatment\nPVRep and/or relief of RVOTO can be performed with low mor-\ntality risk in patients without heart failure and/or advanced ven-\ntricular dysfunction.246 PR is the most frequent reason for\nconsideration of surgery. Optimal timing remains challenging.\nLongitudinal data are more important than single measurements\nto assist timing for reintervention.247 Normalization of RV size\nafter reintervention becomes unlikely as soon as the end systolic\nindex exceeds 80 mL/m2 and the end diastolic volume index\nexceeds 160 mL/m2,248\u0002250 but this cut-off for reintervention may\nnot correlate with clinical benefit. A recent meta-analysis demon-\nstrated that PVRep can improve symptoms and reduce RV vol-\nume, but a survival benefit still needs to be shown.251\nDistal PA stenosis must be addressed, either at the time of surgery\n(including intra-operative stenting) or with a percutaneous approach.\nA biological pulmonary valve (xenograft or homograft) seems to\nhave a mean lifespan of 10\u000220 years,248,252,253 and future replace-\nment\ncould\nbe\nperformed\nby\ntranscatheter\nvalve-in-valve\n©ESC 2020\nFigure 8 Management of repaired tetralogy of Fallot: long-term complications to address during follow-up.\nAo = aorta; LV = left ventricle; RV = right ventricle; PA = Pulmonary artery; TV = tricuspid valve; RA = right atrium; RV = right ventricular; LA = left atrium;\nPA = pulmonary artery; PS = pulmonary stenosis; SCD = sudden cardiac death; VSD = ventricular septal defect.\nESC Guidelines\n613\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/6/563/5898606 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n..............................\nprocedures. There is little experience with mechanical valves in this\nsetting and there is concern about adequate anticoagulation.\nIndications for TV annuloplasty, closure of residual VSDs, and/or\naortic root dilation/AR surgery should also be addressed at the time\nof surgery. The indication for aortic root surgery does not differ from\nthe general population.254\nTPVI techniques have become an alternative to open heart surgery\nprimarily in patients with RVOT conduit stenosis/regurgitation, but\nalso in selected patients with native RVOT regurgitation/stenosis.\nTPVI, when technically feasible, provides outcomes comparable to\nsurgical PVRep and is intended to extend the lifetime of a conduit,\nhence reducing the number of reoperations during a patient’s life-\ntime.255 Stent fracture \u0002 the initially most common complication \u0002\nhas become less of a problem with careful preparation of the ‘landing\nzone’ using additional stents. Best long-term results were reported\nwhen a residual gradient of <15 mmHg could be achieved.256\nUncommon complications, occurring in <2% of patients, include con-\nduit rupture and coronary artery compression. The risk of endocardi-\ntis after TPVI remains a concern with an annual incidence rate of\n2\u00023%.257,258 Since coronary artery compression may be life-\nthreatening, a balloon test to exclude potential coronary artery com-\npression must be performed prior to TPVI, although this test carries\na risk for conduit rupture. In case of severe circumscript conduit cal-\ncification, TPVI should only be performed if a CCT scan shows suffi-\ncient distance between the conduit and the coronary arteries. The\nstrong link between slowly conducting anatomical isthmuses and sus-\ntained monomorphic VT, and the potential loss of accessibility to the\nanatomical isthmus by catheter ablation after surgical PVRep or after\ntranscutaneous insertion of valves in patch augmented RVOTs, has\nimportant implications for patients who undergo reinterventions.259\nWhether pre-interventional mapping and preventive ablation of\nslowly conducting anatomical isthmuses before or during interven-\ntion in patients without documented spontaneous sustained VT is\nbeneficial is under investigation.\n4.10.5\nIndications for electrophysiological testing and\nimplantable cardioverter defibrillator\nAn ICD should be implanted for secondary prevention of SCD\n(patients with cardiac arrest or sustained VT) (IC recommendation).\nICD implantation for primary prevention remains controversial, and\nno ideal risk stratification scheme has so far been developed.

The indication for aortic root surgery does not differ from\nthe general population.254\nTPVI techniques have become an alternative to open heart surgery\nprimarily in patients with RVOT conduit stenosis/regurgitation, but\nalso in selected patients with native RVOT regurgitation/stenosis.\nTPVI, when technically feasible, provides outcomes comparable to\nsurgical PVRep and is intended to extend the lifetime of a conduit,\nhence reducing the number of reoperations during a patient’s life-\ntime.255 Stent fracture \u0002 the initially most common complication \u0002\nhas become less of a problem with careful preparation of the ‘landing\nzone’ using additional stents. Best long-term results were reported\nwhen a residual gradient of <15 mmHg could be achieved.256\nUncommon complications, occurring in <2% of patients, include con-\nduit rupture and coronary artery compression. The risk of endocardi-\ntis after TPVI remains a concern with an annual incidence rate of\n2\u00023%.257,258 Since coronary artery compression may be life-\nthreatening, a balloon test to exclude potential coronary artery com-\npression must be performed prior to TPVI, although this test carries\na risk for conduit rupture. In case of severe circumscript conduit cal-\ncification, TPVI should only be performed if a CCT scan shows suffi-\ncient distance between the conduit and the coronary arteries. The\nstrong link between slowly conducting anatomical isthmuses and sus-\ntained monomorphic VT, and the potential loss of accessibility to the\nanatomical isthmus by catheter ablation after surgical PVRep or after\ntranscutaneous insertion of valves in patch augmented RVOTs, has\nimportant implications for patients who undergo reinterventions.259\nWhether pre-interventional mapping and preventive ablation of\nslowly conducting anatomical isthmuses before or during interven-\ntion in patients without documented spontaneous sustained VT is\nbeneficial is under investigation.\n4.10.5\nIndications for electrophysiological testing and\nimplantable cardioverter defibrillator\nAn ICD should be implanted for secondary prevention of SCD\n(patients with cardiac arrest or sustained VT) (IC recommendation).\nICD implantation for primary prevention remains controversial, and\nno ideal risk stratification scheme has so far been developed.

Follow-up evaluation needs to look for the complications\nlisted in section 4.10.2. All patients should have CMR at regular inter-\nvals, dependent on the pathology found.\n4.10.7\nAdditional considerations\n• Exercise/sports: there are no restrictions in asymptomatic\nrepaired patients with good haemodynamics. Patients at high risk\nfor clinical arrhythmia/SCD, patients with advanced biventricular\ndysfunction, and patients with marked ascending aortopathy\nshould be limited to low-intensity activity/sports and avoid iso-\nmetric exercise.\n• Pregnancy: in unrepaired patients constitutes a considerable risk\nof maternal and foetal complications and death. The risk of preg-\nnancy in repaired patients depends on their haemodynamic sta-\ntus (low in patients with good haemodynamics). In patients with\nsignificant residual lesions, there is a risk of arrhythmia and right\nheart failure. Pregnancy is unlikely to have an adverse long-term\neffect on cardiovascular function262 (see section 3.5.7).\n• IE prophylaxis: recommended only for high-risk patients (see sec-\ntion 3.4.6).\n4.11 Pulmonary atresia with ventricular\nseptal defect\n4.11.1\nIntroduction and background\nAdult patients with pulmonary atresia with VSD are a heterogeneous\npopulation in terms of underlying anatomy, physiology, and previous\ninterventions. Pulmonary atresia þ VSD patients share the intracar-\ndiac anatomy of TOF but lack a direct communication between the\nRV and PAs. Microdeletion 22q11.2 is common (facial anomalies,\nnasal speech, and developmental delay).263 PA supply varies in pul-\nmonary atresia þ VSD, and determines both clinical presentation and\nmanagement (the complexity of the pulmonary vascular bed may\nmake repair unattractive or impossible).\nPatients with discordant cardiac connections and/or a single ven-\ntricle physiology and their management will be discussed in the\nappropriate sections.\nThere are three patterns of PAs:\n• Unifocal with confluent, good-sized PAs supplied by a PDA.\n• Multifocal, with confluent but hypoplastic PAs (‘seagull’ appear-\nance) supplied by multiple MAPCAs.\n• Multifocal with non-confluent or absent PAs supplied by\nMAPCAs.\nSurgical management is a heavily debated topic due to the lack of\nconsensus on the optimal treatment.\nPatients with confluent, good-sized PAs and a pulmonary trunk\n(usually with valvular atresia) are suitable for a Fallot-like repair using\na transannular patch. Patients with good-sized PAs but without a pul-\nmonary trunk should undergo repair with a RV\u0002PA conduit. Patients\nwith confluent but hypoplastic PAs often require an arterial shunt or\nreconstruction of the RVOT (without VSD closure), which may\nenhance PA growth, and then be reviewed at a later stage for repair\nusing a valved conduit. Patients with non-confluent PAs with\nadequate, but not excessive, pulmonary blood flow in infancy can sur-\nvive into adulthood without surgery. There are proponents of a\nstaged unifocalization approach for this latter challenging group of\ninfants, ultimately aiming for a conduit repair.264\n4.11.2\nClinical presentation and natural history\nAt adult age, clinical presentation for repaired patients is similar to\nthose with TOF (see sections 4.10 and 4.14). Unrepaired patients\npresent with exertional dyspnoea, fatigue, and progressive chronic\ncyanosis, due to decreased pulmonary blood flow from collateral\nstenosis, PA stenosis, increased PVR, or increasing ventricular end\ndiastolic pressures.265 Cyanosis will eventually lead to multiorgan\ninvolvement (see section 3.4.8). A number of complications may\noccur in unrepaired patients:\n• Haemoptysis may be due to rupture of usually small collateral\nvessels and/or small PA thrombosis.\n• Chronic heart failure is usually multifactorial and may be due to\nchronic\ncyanosis, early\nexcessive\npulmonary\nblood flow,\nincreased PVR, RV dysfunction, AR, and other causes.\n• Progressive dilation of the ascending aorta with increasing AR\n(rarely aortic dissection).\n• Endocarditis can be particularly compromising in patients with\nlimited cardiovascular reserve and those with significant cyanosis.\n• Arrhythmia and SCD are not uncommon.\n• Segmental PAH.46\n4.11.3\nDiagnostic work-up\nSee section 3.3 for general principles.\n• Clinical findings: cyanosis in unrepaired patients may be profound,\neven with minimal physical effort. Continuous murmurs at the\nback suggest MAPCAs. ECG findings include right-axis deviation\nand RVH. Chest X-ray may show a boot-shaped cardiac contour\n(‘empty PA bay’) with abnormal, decreased pulmonary vascular-\nity (alternating with some areas of increased vascularity through\nlarge MAPCAs).\n• Echocardiography: findings in repaired patients depend on the\ntype of repair (see sections 4.10 and 4.14). For unrepaired\npatients, absence of direct flow from the RV to PA, with continu-\nous flow on multiple sites on colour Doppler from the MAPCAs,\nmay be seen. 3D echocardiography can further aid in delineating\nanatomic pathology and biventricular size and function. TOE is\nuseful in certain patients to evaluate valve anatomy when trans-\nthoracic imaging is challenging or when IE is suspected.266\n• CMR, CCT, and cardiac catheterization are required to deter-\nmine sources of pulmonary blood supply and size of PAs, to\nassess MAPCAs, and obtain haemodynamics. In repaired patients,\nCMR is used for requirements similar to patients with TOF [for\nRV volumes and function, PR, size, shape, and expansion of the\nPAs, and the size of the ascending aorta, and for residual shunt\n(Qp:Qs)]. 3D rotational angiography and 3D overlay imaging, as\nESC Guidelines\n615\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/6/563/5898606 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n......................................................................................................................................................................\nwell as X-ray and magnetic resonance imaging fusion, aid in preci-\nsion assessment.267\n4.11.4\nSurgical/catheter interventional treatment\nFor follow-up and intervention in patients with Fallot-like repair with\ntransannular patch, see section 4.10; for patients with repair using a\nvalved RV\u0002PA conduit, see section 4.14.\nPatients with pulmonary atresia þ VSD surviving unrepaired to\nadulthood, or with previous palliative procedures, may actually bene-\nfit from modern surgical or interventional procedures.268,269 Patients\nwith good-sized confluent PAs and those with large MAPCAs ana-\ntomically suitable for unifocalization, who have not developed severe\nPVD due to protecting stenosis, should be considered for surgery.\nMany unrepaired patients may, however, not be suitable for further\nsurgery, mainly because of the complexity of their pulmonary vascu-\nlature. It is important to appreciate that while cardiac surgery may\nimprove clinical status or prognosis (the latter is purely speculative),\nit is also a major cause of mortality.\nCatheter intervention may include balloon dilation/stenting of col-\nlateral vessels to enhance pulmonary blood flow.270 On the other\nhand, patients with severe haemoptysis may require coiling of rup-\ntured collateral vessels.\nSurvival depends on the complexity of the pulmonary malforma-\ntions and the results of surgical repair. Survival in palliated patients is\nsignificantly lower and has been reported as 60% at 20-year follow-\nup. Heart-lung transplantation could possibly be an option for highly\nselected individuals.\n4.11.5\nFollow-up recommendations\nPatients with pulmonary atresia þ VSD should have periodic follow-\nup in a specialized ACHD centre (at least once a year). For the man-\nagement of cyanosis-related multiorgan involvement, see section\n3.4.8.\nPatients with segmental PAH may be considered for targeted PAH\ntherapy; see section 3.4.3.271,272\nSymptoms such as dyspnoea, increasing cyanosis, change in the\nshunt murmur, heart failure, or arrhythmias warrant special attention\nand should necessitate an earlier review and assessment for\nintervention.\n4.11.6\nAdditional considerations\n• Exercise/sports: those with excellent haemodynamics should be\nencouraged to exercise regularly, avoiding only extreme isomet-\nric exercise. Those with less optimal haemodynamics will be\nmore functionally limited. Extremes of exertion should be\navoided, but regular low-intensity physical activity (walking, swim-\nming, even cycling) should be encouraged.\n• Pregnancy: the risk of pregnancy in repaired patients with good\nhaemodynamics and no history of arrhythmias is low. The risk\nincreases with hypoxaemia, PAH, ventricular dysfunction, heart\nfailure symptoms, and arrhythmias (see section 3.5.7). As micro-\ndeletion 22q11 is fairly common with this defect, patients should\nbe checked before pregnancy.\n• IE prophylaxis: recommended only for high-risk patients (includ-\ning all unrepaired patients; see section 3.4.6).\n4.12 Transposition of the great arteries\n4.12.1\nIntroduction and background\nTGA is characterized by AV concordance and ventriculo-arterial dis-\ncordance: the aorta originates from the RV, the PA from the LV.\nTGA is called simple in the absence of associated congenital anoma-\nlies; TGA is called complex in the presence of associated anomalies:\nVSD (\u000345%), LVOTO (\u000325%), and CoA (\u00035%). Long-term out-\ncome of complex TGA is, regardless of the type of surgical repair,\nworse than that of simple TGA.\nThe aetiology of TGA is unknown and the pathogenesis is contro-\nversial. Familial occurrence exists but is very rare. There is a 2:1 male\npreponderance.\nNatural history is extremely poor and survival to adult life without\nsurgical repair is the exception. Surgical techniques have evolved:\natrial switch transitioned to arterial switch procedure, and complex\nTGAs are often operated upon using a Rastelli-type repair.\nA schematic overview of surgical techniques and their long-term\ncomplications in TGA is provided in Figure 9.\n4.12.2\nAtrial switch operation\n4.12.2.1 Clinical presentation after atrial switch\nOlder adults with a simple TGA have a Mustard or Senning atrial\nswitch procedure. The most common complications are:\n• Systemic RV dysfunction and failure.\n• Secondary progressive TR (systemic AV valve).\n• Bradycardia and chronotropic incompetence due to loss of sinus\nrhythm; AV conduction is usually intact.\n• Supraventricular\ntachyarrhythmia,\ntypically\ncavotricuspid\nisthmus-dependent flutter, followed by macro-reentry circuit\nrelated to surgical incisions/scars; AF may occur at older age.\nHigh heart rates are often haemodynamically poorly tolerated\nbecause of the inability to increase preload, a consequence of the\n(restrictive) atrial baffles. Bradycardia due to SND can promote\nAT.\n• Ventricular tachyarrhythmias: primary polymorphic VT or VF\ndue to poor ventricular function and heart failure-related mecha-\nnism, or monomorphic VT due to scar/incision/patch-related\nreentry in repaired complex TGA; secondary VT or VF, pre-\nceded by supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with rapid conduc-\ntion and consecutive myocardial ischaemia due to the very low\nstroke volume associated with the SVT.\n• Baffle stenosis, either superior baffle (most common) or inferior\nbaffle obstruction.\n• Baffle leakage, with either L\u0002R shunt giving rise to pulmonary\noverflow or R\u0002L shunting in the presence of distal flow obstruc-\ntion, with cyanosis or paradoxical embolism.\n• Pulmonary veins/venous atrial obstruction, most often at the site\nwhere the pulmonary veins connect to the pulmonary venous\natrium/RA.\n616\nESC Guidelines\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/6/563/5898606 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n©ESC 2020\nFigure 9 Management of transposition of the great arteries: long-term complications to address during follow-up.\nAo = aorta; AV = atrioventricular; IVC = inferior caval vein; LA = left atrium; LV = left ventricle; LVOT = left ventricular (subpulmonary) outflow tract; PS\n= pulmonary stenosis (supravalvular/pulmonary artery branch); PV = pulmonary vein; PVA = pulmonary venous atrium; RA = right atrium; RV = right ven-\ntricle; SCD = sudden cardiac death; SN-dysf. = sinus node dysfunction; SVA = systemic venous atrium; SVC = superior vena cava; TV = tricuspid valve.\nESC Guidelines\n617\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/6/563/5898606 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n........................................................................................................................................................................\n• LVOTO can develop due to bulging of the interventricular sep-\ntum towards the low-pressure subpulmonic LV, frequently asso-\nciated with systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve.\n• PH can become manifest, sometimes decades after the atrial\nswitch procedure; it is usually post-capillary273 but PAH may be\npresent too.\n• Death due to heart failure or sudden death, probably caused by\narrhythmia.\nIn larger series with follow-up of up to 40 years, survival is\n60\u000275%.274,275 Event-free survival is as low as 20%.276,277 Exercise\ncapacity is usually reduced by inadequate increase in cardiac output:\nchronotropic incompetence, reduced preload resulting from the rel-\natively narrowed and/or non-compliant baffles \u0002 inherent to the\natrial switch operation \u0002 and diminished RV function.\n4.12.2.2 Diagnostic work-up\nSee section 3.3 for general principles.\nClinical evaluation must include looking for signs of venous conges-\ntion. A swollen head and neck are a sign of superior baffle obstruc-\ntion. Oedema of the legs, varices, hepatomegaly, and liver cirrhosis\nare seen in inferior baffle obstruction. Stenosis, even complete\nobstruction, can be asymptomatic due to an effective bypass circula-\ntion provided by the azygos or hemiazygos vein.\nAn\nejection-type\nsystolic\nmurmur\nsuggests\nsubpulmonary\noutflow tract obstruction, and a systolic regurgitant-type murmur\nsuggests regurgitation of the systemic TV. ECG findings include RVH\nand, not uncommonly, narrow QRS escape rhythm, without visible P\nwaves.\n• Echocardiography is the first-line diagnostic modality, providing\ninformation on size and systolic function of the subpulmonic and\nsystemic ventricles, subpulmonary outflow tract obstruction, TR,\nleakage or obstruction of the atrial baffles, and assessment of pul-\nmonary venous return. Signs of PH are often subtle \u0002 decreased\nflattening of the interventricular septum in systole and an abnor-\nmally wide PA \u0002 and can be difficult to recognize. Suspicion of\nPH dictates diagnostic heart catheterization to exclude/confirm\nPH as it may impact management. Contrast echocardiography\ncan demonstrate baffle leakage \u0002 present in up to 50% in non-\nselected and asymptomatic patients \u0002 or baffle obstruction.278\nInjection of contrast into the upper limbs frequently misses a leak\nin the inferior systemic venous baffle; this can only be excluded\nby injection into one of the femoral veins. TOE is useful for evalu-\nation of baffles.\n• CMR provides more reliable and more robust quantitative\nassessment of systemic RV systolic function than echocardiogra-\nphy, and of patency of the atrial baffles. Size of the great arteries\ncan be measured reliably; an abnormally wide PA and/or large\nsubpulmonary LV may indicate PH. Shunt related to baffle leak\ncan be quantified (Qp:Qs). Small baffle leaks not leading to a rele-\nvant shunt are difficult to detect with CMR (contrast echocar-\ndiography is superior). Late gadolinium enhancement in the\nsystemic RV predicts clinical outcome.279\n• Exclusion of superior baffle stenosis or baffle leak (and treat-\nment) is essential before PM/ICD implantation or placing new/\nadditional pacemaker wires through the superior baffle. An alter-\nnative to CMR and CCT for assessment of the superior baffle is\ncontrast injection in the right arm and fluoroscopy.\n• CPET is important in longitudinal follow-up for serial assessment\nof exercise capacity and chronotropic incompetence. It also can\n‘unmask’ baffle leakage (desaturation) that is asymptomatic at\nrest.\n• Holter monitoring, event recorder, and EP testing are indicated\nfor selected patients if bradycardia and/or tachyarrhythmias are\nsuspected.\n• Cardiac catheterization is indicated when non-invasive assess-\nment is inconclusive or when suspicion of PH requires evaluation\n(see section 3.3.5).\n4.12.2.3 Medical treatment\n• Systemic RV systolic dysfunction: there are no data to support\nthe hypothesis that ACE inhibitors, ARBs, beta blockers, or\naldosterone antagonists \u0002 alone or in combination \u0002 improve\noutcome.280 No solid recommendation can currently be made.\n• Systemic RV failure: in the case of overt heart failure, diuretics\nrelieve symptoms. Although no benefit has been demonstrated\nfor conventional heart failure medical therapy in patients with\nsystemic RVs, more symptomatic patients may benefit from pre-\nscription of ‘classical’ heart failure medication.\n• Arrhythmia: drugs that lower heart rate should be used with cau-\ntion, since after atrial switch, patients are prone to bradycardia\nand SND.\n• PH: the exact mechanism of PH must be elucidated before con-\nsideration of medical treatment. Post-capillary PH late after atrial\nswitch operation seems to be most common, with the conse-\nquence that specific pulmonary vasodilator therapy is contraindi-\ncated but pre-capillary PH may be present, too. Thus, careful\nhaemodynamic evaluation is crucial.\n4.12.2.4 Surgical/catheter interventional treatment\nElectrophysiology testing, ablation, cardiac resynchronization ther-\napy, and implantable cardioverter defibrillators.\nGeneral principles, also valid for patients with the atrial switch pro-\ncedure, are discussed in section 3.4.2.32,37\n• EP studies and interventions are complicated because baffles\ninterfere with normal access to the atria. The dominant mecha-\nnism of supraventricular arrhythmias is cavotricuspid isthmus\natrial flutter, often requiring baffle puncture to achieve isthmus\nblock. Alternatively, remote magnetic navigation can be used for\nretrograde\naccess\nto\nthe\npulmonary\nvenous\natrium.\nConventional retrograde transaortic route access in adults is usu-\nally not successful to achieve isthmus block. TOE guidance is rec-\nommended when puncture of a baffle is indicated. Programmed\nelectrical stimulation for risk stratification is not useful.\n• Pacemakers: see section 3.4.2.\nIndications\nfor\nintervention\nare\nsummarized\nin\nthe\nRecommendations for surgical and catheter intervention in TGA after atrial\nswitch operation table.\n618\nESC Guidelines\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/6/563/5898606 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n.............................................................................................................................................................................\n4.12.3\nArterial switch operation\n4.12.3.1 Clinical presentation after arterial switch\nYoung adults with a simple TGA will probably have had an arterial\nswitch operation. The most common complications are:\n• Neo-aortic root dilatation, resulting in AR.\n• Supravalvular PS and pulmonary branch stenosis (unilaterally or\nbilaterally), a consequence of the position of the pulmonary bifur-\ncation anterior to the ascending aorta in the Lecompte technique\nand the dilatation of the neo-aortic root.\n• LV dysfunction and ventricular arrhythmias are rare but may\noccur; both may be related to problems with the coronary\narteries,281 which were reimplanted in the neo-aorta.\n• Acute angle of the aortic arch, which may lead to functional\nobstruction and hypertension.\nSurvival up to 30 years is excellent (>90% of hospital survivors282)\nand event-free survival is fair (60\u000280%283\u0002285). A large majority of\nthese patients are asymptomatic. As a rule, exercise capacity is mildly\nreduced, but it can be normal. The incidence of late coronary artery-\nrelated problems is reported to be very low,286,287 which makes it\nquestionable whether routine screening of coronary arteries is justified.\n4.12.3.2 Diagnostic work-up\nSee section 3.3 for general principles. Clinical findings of AR or PS may be\npresent.\n• Echocardiography is the key diagnostic modality, providing infor-\nmation on LV function (global and regional); stenosis at the arte-\nrial anastomotic sites, most commonly PS; neo-aortic valve\nregurgitation; dimension of the neo-aortic root and proximal\nascending aorta; and the acute angulation of the aortic arch. RV\nsystolic function can be assessed and, if possible, peak RV systolic\npressure (RVSP) should be measured (TR velocity). Due to its\nposition: far anteriorly and just behind the sternum, echocardio-\ngraphic visualization of the bifurcation and both branches is rarely\npossible.\n• Stress echocardiography is used to assess stress-induced wall-\nmotion abnormalities.\n• CMR provides more reliable quantitative assessment of ventricu-\nlar volumes, EF, and neo-aortic dilatation or regurgitation.\nPulmonary trunk and branches can be visualized, together with\ntheir relation to the (dilated) neo-aortic root. Flow distribution\nbetween left and right lung can be calculated. Stress CMR is an\nalternative technique to assess myocardial perfusion and possible\ncoronary artery compromise, where clinically indicated.\n• CCT is the preferred technique for non-invasive imaging of coro-\nnary arteries, including the ostia, when stenosis is suspected. The\nreported low incidence of coronary-related problems makes it\nquestionable whether routine screening for coronary artery\npathologies (with whatever modality) can be justified.286,287\n• Nuclear techniques are no longer used as first-choice imaging\nmodality but may still have a role if other techniques are not avail-\nable or lead to inconclusive or contradictory results.\n• Cardiac catheterization, including coronary angiography, is indi-\ncated in the case of LV dysfunction and suspicion of myocardial\nischaemia.

Indications for treatment are similar to those\ndescribed in section 4.8, but different anatomies may require different\napproaches.\n4.12.4\nRastelli-type operation\n4.12.4.1 Clinical presentation after Rastelli-type repair\nAdults with TGA, VSD, and PS (complex transposition) have often\nhad a Rastelli-type repair. The VSD patch directs blood from the LV\nto the aorta and the RV is connected to the PA with a valved conduit.\nVariants of the Rastelli technique, sharing the same principle, are the\nre´paration \u0002a l’etage ventriculaire and Nikaidoh techniques.\nCommon complications are:\n• Stenosis or regurgitation of the valved conduit between the RV\nand the PA.\n• LVOTO, i.e. obstruction of the flow from the LV to the aorta.\n• Residual VSD.\n• AR.\n• LV dysfunction.\n• Arrhythmias, both ventricular and supraventricular.\n• Endocarditis of the valved conduit.\n• Death, either sudden (arrhythmia) or due to heart failure.\nThe few long-term outcome studies report 20-year survival <60%\nand 20-year event-free survival 20\u000230%. Replacement of the conduit\nbetween the RV and PA is the most common indication for\nreoperation. Relief of LVOTO is the second most common, followed\nby closure of a residual VSD.288 Endocarditis of the valved conduit is\nrelatively common.\nExercise capacity is mildly to substantially diminished. Repeat rein-\ntervention, surgical or percutaneous, is the fate of most patients with\na Rastelli-type repair.\n4.12.4.2 Diagnostic work-up\nSee section 3.3 for general principles.\nClinical findings may suggest conduit stenosis, residual VSD, TR,\nmitral regurgitation, or AR.\n• Echocardiography: the connection between the posteriorly posi-\ntioned LV and the anteriorly positioned (due to the TGA) aortic\nvalve, aortic valve function, and aortic root diameters should be\nassessed. The anatomy and function of the conduit between the\nRV and the pulmonary trunk must be visualized and assessed\nwith Doppler interrogation. RV pressure assessed with Doppler\nmeasurement of TR jet velocity is of particular importance\nbecause the Doppler technique often overestimates the pressure\ngradient across the RV\u0002PA conduit.\n• CMR provides a more robust quantification of LV and RV vol-\numes, aortic diameters, and EF. The RV\u0002PA conduit, often diffi-\ncult to visualize by echocardiogram, and peripheral PAs can be\nreadily seen and measured with CMR. In the presence of a resid-\nual VSD, Qp:Qs can be calculated.\n• Cardiac catheterization may be required for haemodynamic\nassessment of conduit stenosis.

Replacement of the conduit\nbetween the RV and PA is the most common indication for\nreoperation. Relief of LVOTO is the second most common, followed\nby closure of a residual VSD.288 Endocarditis of the valved conduit is\nrelatively common.\nExercise capacity is mildly to substantially diminished. Repeat rein-\ntervention, surgical or percutaneous, is the fate of most patients with\na Rastelli-type repair.\n4.12.4.2 Diagnostic work-up\nSee section 3.3 for general principles.\nClinical findings may suggest conduit stenosis, residual VSD, TR,\nmitral regurgitation, or AR.\n• Echocardiography: the connection between the posteriorly posi-\ntioned LV and the anteriorly positioned (due to the TGA) aortic\nvalve, aortic valve function, and aortic root diameters should be\nassessed. The anatomy and function of the conduit between the\nRV and the pulmonary trunk must be visualized and assessed\nwith Doppler interrogation. RV pressure assessed with Doppler\nmeasurement of TR jet velocity is of particular importance\nbecause the Doppler technique often overestimates the pressure\ngradient across the RV\u0002PA conduit.\n• CMR provides a more robust quantification of LV and RV vol-\numes, aortic diameters, and EF. The RV\u0002PA conduit, often diffi-\ncult to visualize by echocardiogram, and peripheral PAs can be\nreadily seen and measured with CMR. In the presence of a resid-\nual VSD, Qp:Qs can be calculated.\n• Cardiac catheterization may be required for haemodynamic\nassessment of conduit stenosis. Angiography can be helpful for\nassessing the level of stenosis and peripheral PA stenosis.\n4.12.4.3 Surgical/catheter interventional treatment\nFor indications for treatment of conduit stenosis, see section 4.14.\nIf L\u0002R shunting through a residual VSD causes symptoms or sub-\nstantial LV volume overload, surgical/catheter treatment should be\nperformed (IC recommendation).\n4.12.5\nFollow-up recommendations (irrespective of\ntype of repair)\nAll patients with TGA, regardless of the type of operation, should be\nseen at least annually in a specialized ACHD centre, with attention\ngiven to the specific issues previously described (see sections 4.12.2.1,\n4.12.3.1 and 4.12.4.1).\n4.12.6\nAdditional considerations (irrespective of type of\nrepair)\n• Exercise/pregnancy/IE prophylaxis: see sections 3.4.6, 3.5.5 and\n3.5.7.\n4.13 Congenitally corrected\ntransposition of the great arteries\n4.13.1\nIntroduction and background\nccTGA, or discordant atrio-ventricular and ventriculo-arterial con-\nnections, is uncommon. The ventricles are inverted, with the aorta\narising anteriorly from the RV (usually on the left side) and the PA\narising posteriorly from the LV (usually on the right side). The abnor-\nmal connections in ‘double’ discordance may be present in hearts\nRecommendations for intervention in transposition of\nthe great arteries after arterial switch operation\nRecommendations\nClassa\nLevelb\nStenting or surgery (depending on substrate) is\nrecommended for coronary artery stenosis\ncausing ischaemia.\nI\nC\nNeo-aortic root surgery should be considered\nwhen the neo-aortic root is >55 mm, providing\naverage adult stature (for neo-aortic valve replace-\nment for severe neo-aortic AR see valvular heart\ndisease guidelines with special considerationsc).\nIIa\nC\nStenting should be considered for PA branch\nstenosis, regardless of symptoms, if >50% diam-\neter narrowing and RVSP >50 mmHg and/or\nrelated reduced lung perfusion are present.\nIIa\nC\nAR = aortic regurgitation; ESC = European Society of Cardiology; PA = pulmo-\nnary artery; RVSP = right ventricular systolic pressure.\naClass of recommendation.\nbLevel of evidence.\ncWhen applying the 2017 ESC/EACTS valvular heart disease Guidelines25 for the\ndecision to operate, it has to be taken into account that this is a reoperation and\ntechnically more difﬁcult.\n620\nESC Guidelines\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/6/563/5898606 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n.....................................................................................................\nwith usual or mirror-image atrial arrangement. Abnormal base-apex\norientation, especially dextrocardia (apex of the heart pointed to the\nright), is common (20%). Associated lesions are common (80\u000290%):\nVSD (70%), PS (40%), dysplastic systemic TV (e.g. Ebstein-like\nmalformation).\nThe position of the AV node (sometimes multiple AV nodes), and\nthe course of the bundle of His, are often abnormal and lead to AV\nconduction abnormalities. The anterior and lateral displacement of a\nfragile His bundle is important to recognize during EP studies and\ncatheter interventions.\n4.13.2\nClinical presentation and natural history\nThe natural history and clinical presentation are determined by asso-\nciated malformations. Patients with associated lesions reaching adult-\nhood have either been operated upon [closure of VSD, relief of PS\nor (rarely) TV repair or replacement] or have a balanced physiology.\nPatients with isolated ccTGA rarely develop complications before\nadulthood.\nLate complications are:\n• Systemic RV dysfunction and failure.\n• Progressive TR (systemic AV valve).\n• LVOTO.\n• Complete AV block (2% loss of AV conduction per year); it is\nmore common after VSD repair and/or TV replacement and may\noccur during pregnancy.\n• VTs (extremely rare).\nLife expectancy is reduced: \u000350% of patients with associated\nlesions were alive at the age of 40 years; without associated lesions,\n\u000350% of patients were alive at the age of 60 years.

Wolff\u0002\nParkinson\u0002White syndrome is present in 2\u00024% of patients.\n• Chest X-ray may show an abnormally straight left heart border\ndue to the leftward and anterior position of the ascending aorta,\ndextroposition with apex to the right (20%), or mesocardia (rela-\ntively common).\n• Echocardiography is the key diagnostic modality, demonstrating\ndouble\ndiscordance\nand\nidentifying\nassociated\nanomalies\n(Ebstein-like malformation of the TV and TR, VSD, LVOTO, and\nPS). Systolic RV and LV function and severity of TR can be quali-\ntatively assessed.\n• CMR provides intracardiac and great vessel anatomy and is indi-\ncated for quantification of ventricular volumes, mass, and EF,\nespecially since echocardiographic assessment of systolic func-\ntion in systemic RVs is difficult and less reliable.\n• Holter monitoring, event recorder, and EP testing may be indi-\ncated for detection of arrhythmias, progressive AV block, and for\nrisk assessment for SCD.\n• Cardiac\ncatheterization\nis\nindicated\nwhen\nnon-invasive\nassessment is inconclusive, or PH requires evaluation (see section\n3.4.5).\n4.13.4\nMedical treatment\nThere\nare\nno\ndata\nto\nsupport\nthe\nhypothesis\nthat\nACE\ninhibitors, ARBs, beta blockers or aldosterone antagonists, alone or\nin combination, improve outcome.280 Routine prescription of these\nmedications to prevent heart failure/improve outcome is not\nrecommended.\n• Diuretics may provide relief of symptoms if overt heart failure is\npresent.

Patients die from\ncongestive heart failure or die suddenly, presumably due to VT/VF,\nregardless of the presence of advanced heart failure.\n4.13.3\nDiagnostic work-up\nSee section 3.3 for general principles.\n• Clinical findings may include murmurs of TR, VSD, and/or PS.\n• ECG may reveal a prolonged PR interval or a complete heart block.\nEarly septal activation from right to left may cause deep Q waves in\nII, III, aVF, and V1\u0002V3. Reversal of the normal precordial progression\nmay be seen as a QR pattern in V1 and rS in V6. Wolff\u0002\nParkinson\u0002White syndrome is present in 2\u00024% of patients.\n• Chest X-ray may show an abnormally straight left heart border\ndue to the leftward and anterior position of the ascending aorta,\ndextroposition with apex to the right (20%), or mesocardia (rela-\ntively common).\n• Echocardiography is the key diagnostic modality, demonstrating\ndouble\ndiscordance\nand\nidentifying\nassociated\nanomalies\n(Ebstein-like malformation of the TV and TR, VSD, LVOTO, and\nPS). Systolic RV and LV function and severity of TR can be quali-\ntatively assessed.\n• CMR provides intracardiac and great vessel anatomy and is indi-\ncated for quantification of ventricular volumes, mass, and EF,\nespecially since echocardiographic assessment of systolic func-\ntion in systemic RVs is difficult and less reliable.\n• Holter monitoring, event recorder, and EP testing may be indi-\ncated for detection of arrhythmias, progressive AV block, and for\nrisk assessment for SCD.\n• Cardiac\ncatheterization\nis\nindicated\nwhen\nnon-invasive\nassessment is inconclusive, or PH requires evaluation (see section\n3.4.5).\n4.13.4\nMedical treatment\nThere\nare\nno\ndata\nto\nsupport\nthe\nhypothesis\nthat\nACE\ninhibitors, ARBs, beta blockers or aldosterone antagonists, alone or\nin combination, improve outcome.280 Routine prescription of these\nmedications to prevent heart failure/improve outcome is not\nrecommended.\n• Diuretics may provide relief of symptoms if overt heart failure is\npresent. Although there is no proven benefit from heart failure\nmedical therapy, in terms of outcome in patients with systemic\nRVs, ‘classical’ heart failure medications or ARBs may provide\nsome benefit in more symptomatic patients.289 A systemic RV\nmorphology is not a contraindication for a ventricular assist\ndevice. The coarse trabecularization of the RV apex may deserve\nspecial consideration, since it may block the inflow cannula.\nSelective myomectomy should be considered.\n4.13.5\nSurgical/catheter interventional treatment\nCatheter intervention may be recommended for PA stenosis or con-\nduit stenosis, which can be dilated or stented. However, a residual\nLVOTO may have a beneficial effect on the dilated subaortic RV and\nsubaortic AV (tricuspid) valve regurgitation because of the septal\nshift. If complete heart block occurs, AV sequential pacing is the\nstandard. Fixation of the pacemaker wire in the smooth-walled LV is\ndifficult and requires a screw-in electrode. There are some data sug-\ngesting that biventricular pacing with a second ventricular wire\nthrough the (normally connecting) coronary sinus behind the sub-\naortic RV may lead to a better preservation of RV systolic function\nthan LV pacing alone.290\nRecommendations for intervention in congenitally cor-\nrected transposition of the great arteries\nRecommendations\nClassa\nLevelb\nIn symptomatic patients with severe TR and pre-\nserved or mildly impaired systemic RV systolic\nfunction (EF >40%), TV replacement is indicated.\nI\nC\nIn asymptomatic patients with severe TR and pro-\ngressive systemic RV dilatation and/or mildly\nimpaired systemic RV systolic function (EF >40%),\nTV replacement should be considered.\nIIa\nC\nBiventricular pacing should be considered in case\nof complete AV block or >40% ventricular pacing\nrequirement.\nIIa\nC\nIn symptomatic patients with severe TR and more\nthan mildly reduced systemic RV systolic function\n(EF <_40%), TV replacement may be considered.\nIIb\nC\nAV = atrioventricular; EF = ejection fraction; RV = right ventricle/ventricular; TR\n= tricuspid regurgitation; TV = tricuspid valve.\naClass of recommendation.\nbLevel of evidence.\nESC Guidelines\n621\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/6/563/5898606 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n..............................................................................\nThe most challenging questions are TR, RV dysfunction, and when\nto implant a TV and/or an ICD.

Special attention should be given to exercise capacity\n(CPET), RVSP (conduit gradient), RV function, TR, and arrhythmias.\n4.14.5\nAdditional considerations\n• Exercise/sports: no restrictions are required in asymptomatic\npatients with mild obstruction. High-risk patients with high RV\npressure must limit themselves to low-intensity activity/sports\nand avoid isometric exercise. Other patients should limit them-\nselves according to symptoms.\n• Pregnancy: maternal and foetal risks are driven by the underlying\ncongenital heart defect and severity of RVOTO, arrhythmia, and\nheart failure (see section 3.5.7).\n• IE prophylaxis: recommended in all patients (see section 3.4.6).\n4.15 Univentricular heart\nThis section deals with unoperated and palliated univentricular heart\n(UVH). For patients after Fontan operation see section 4.16.\n4.15.1\nIntroduction and background\nThe term ‘UVH’ summarizes a variety of malformations where either\nthe RV or LV is missing or, if present, is hypoplastic and thus not ame-\nnable for biventricular repair, such as:\n• Tricuspid atresia.\n• Hypoplastic right heart syndrome variants, e.g. pulmonary atresia\nwith intact ventricular septum variants.\n• Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) variants, including mitral\natresia.\n• Double-inlet LV.\n• Double-inlet RV.\n• Extreme forms of unbalanced complete AV septal defects.\n• Single ventricle with undefined morphology.\nThese malformations are always associated with additional intra-\nand/or extracardiac lesions such as:\n• ASD, VSD, AVSD, PDA.\n• AS (valvular, subvalvular).\n• Aortic arch anomalies: hypoplasia, interruption, coarctation.\n• PS (valvular, subvalvular), pulmonary atresia.\n• PA anomalies: peripheral stenosis, hypoplasia, one-sided absence.\n• Discordant connections, malposition of the great arteries.\n• AV valve stenosis, regurgitation, overriding, straddling.\n• LA or RA isomerism, abnormal systemic or pulmonary venous\nconnections.\n• Left SVC, absent innominate vein, absent right SVC, absent infra-\nhepatic IVC with azygos or hemiazygos continuity.\n• Aortic-to-pulmonary collateral arteries.\n• Polysplenia or asplenia.\nDetailed anatomic description is beyond the scope of these guide-\nlines and can be found in textbooks. Owing to the lack of data, rec-\nommendations are mainly based on expert consensus.296\u0002300 When\npresenting as adults, the vast majority of patients with these condi-\ntions will have undergone previous palliation with some type of\nsystemic-to-PA shunt, cavopulmonary connection (Glenn), or now\npreferably a Fontan operation or one of its modifications; the latter is\ncovered in section 4.16.\nTwo different haemodynamic situations can be identified:\n• No anatomic restriction to pulmonary blood flow: if pulmonary\ncirculation remains unmodified (i.e. no surgery), many patients\nwill die in childhood due to intractable heart failure. Those who\nsurvive this period will have developed severe PVD. This will be a\nmain determinant of long-term outcome. Many will have had pul-\nmonary banding to restrict pulmonary blood flow in early child-\nhood. An effective banding will protect against PVD, while\nallowing enough pulmonary blood flow to limit the degree of cya-\nnosis. A banding that is too loose will result in pulmonary over-\nflow and PVD despite the banding. If the banding is too tight,\npulmonary blood flow will be extremely limited, resulting in\nsevere cyanosis.\n• Obstruction to pulmonary blood flow (frequently valvular and/or\nsubvalvular PS or atresia): sometimes the obstruction is such that\nthe pulmonary circulation is adequate (not excessive, thus avoid-\ning development of PH, and not too restricted, thus without\nextreme cyanosis). These balanced situations are the exception\nbut allow survival into adulthood without having surgery. Most\npatients have a very restricted pulmonary blood flow, necessitat-\ning a systemic-to-PA shunt operation in childhood \u0002 most com-\nmonly Blalock\u0002Taussig (subclavian to PA), rarely Waterston or\nPotts (ascending or descending aorta to PA, respectively). If a\nsystemic-to-PA shunt is too large, pulmonary overflow will result\nin PVD at adult age. If the shunt is too small, patients will be\nextremely cyanotic. Beyond infancy, an anastomosis between the\nSVC and PA is a possibility: the classical Glenn anastomosis to the\nright PA (historical) or an end-to-side anastomosis with the PA,\ncreating\na\nbidirectional\ncavopulmonary\nanastomosis.\nAn\nadequate shunt will lead to a balanced situation.\n4.15.2\nClinical presentation and natural history\nDepending on the extent of pulmonary blood flow, presence or\nabsence of PVD, and ventricular function, patients may present with\nvarious degrees of cyanosis and congestive heart failure. Exercise abil-\nity is generally substantially reduced (with exceptions); complete AV\nblock, arrhythmias (supraventricular, but also ventricular, SCD not\nunusual), stroke, brain abscess, and thromboembolism can occur.\nEndocarditis is relatively common in this population. For more\ndetails, see section 3.4.8.\nCyanosis is typically present in patients with UVH without a\nFontan operation. Arterial oxygen saturation commonly ranges from\n75\u000285% but may, in exceptional cases with ideally balanced circula-\ntions, reach values >90%.\nPatients may present with progressive obstruction towards the\naorta. This will lead to ventricular hypertrophy and, eventually, to\nreduced cardiac output. Progressive obstruction towards the PA will\ncause progressive cyanosis. In Glenn patients, worsening cyanosis\nmay also be due to development of pulmonary arteriovenous malfor-\nmations or IVC-to-SVC collaterals.\nThe UVH has to accommodate both systemic and pulmonary\nvenous return. This chronic volume overload will lead to a high likeli-\nhood of ventricular failure relatively early in life. AV valve regurgita-\ntion may develop or progress, if present previously.

Eventually,\novert heart failure may develop, in addition to the cyanosis.\nIn rare cases, with a well-balanced haemodynamic situation, ven-\ntricular dysfunction does not develop, and survival until the fifth, sixth,\nand even seventh decade has been reported.\n4.15.3\nDiagnostic work-up\nSee section 3.3 for general principles.\nClinical findings include central cyanosis, clubbing of fingers\nand toes, and often an asymmetric chest with a precordial heave\nat the side where the heart lies in the chest. Scoliosis is a common\nproblem. The second heart sound is typically single, but the rest of\nthe auscultation depends on the associated abnormalities. ECG may\nreveal rhythm or conduction disturbances. Atrial reentrant tachycar-\ndia with 2:1 block and only modest tachycardia may be easily\noverlooked.\n• TTE is the key diagnostic technique, providing information on\nanatomy and monitoring of cardiac function during follow-up. The\nsegmental approach is required in the echocardiographic exami-\nnation; UVHs are always complex and can present with a wide\nrange of abnormalities in situs, orientation, and connections.\nFundamental TTE parameters/issues/items in the diagnosis of\nUVHs are:\n- Abdominal and atrial situs.\n- Position of the heart in the chest and position of the apex.\n- Veno-atrial, AV, and ventriculo-arterial connections.\n- Morphological and haemodynamic information has to be\nobtained on the entire heart.\n- Exact anatomy of the ventriculo-arterial connection and its\nfunctional status has to be assessed, with special focus on\nobstruction towards the aorta or pulmonary vascular bed.\n- AV valve function should be evaluated, with special focus on\nregurgitation.\n- Ventricular function/hypertrophy.\n- ASD/VSD type, size, number, location.\n- Ascending aorta, aortic arch, and descending aorta; detect/\nexclude coarctation.\n- PAs \u0002 common trunk, branches, and sources of pulmonary\nblood supply.\n- Visualization of shunts (Blalock\u0002Taussig, Waterston, etc.).\nTOE may be indicated in cases of inadequate TTE images.\n• CMR is the imaging modality of choice for extracardiac anatomy,\nincluding veno-atrial and ventriculo-arterial connections (CCT is\nan alternative). Detailed morphological information of intracar-\ndiac anatomy can also be obtained. CMR is also the method of\nchoice for quantification of ventricular volumes, EF, and relative\ndistribution of blood flow in the left and right lungs.\n• Cardiac catheterization is required when intervention is consid-\nered for haemodynamic assessment, in particular PAP and trans-\npulmonary gradient (PVR is often difficult to assess in this\nsetting). It is mandatory when patients are evaluated for a Fontan\noperation. Evaluation of systemic-to-PA or Glenn shunts \u0002 and\ntheir sequelae (stenosis of the pulmonary branches) and other\nvascular anomalies (arteriovenous collateral vessels, fistulas, etc.)\n\u0002 may also require catheterization.\nInterventional treatment, such as pulmonary valvotomy to\nincrease pulmonary blood flow in cases of severe PS, is debatable.\nIf the clinical situation is stable, the (frequently high) risk of any\ntype of surgical intervention should be weighed very carefully against\nthe possible benefit.\nA Fontan operation can only be considered in very well\nselected patients (see section 4.16). For patients with severe cya-\nnosis, with decreased pulmonary blood flow without elevated\nPVR, a bidirectional Glenn shunt (SVC-to-PA) can be an option.\nIf a systemic-to-pulmonary shunt (e.g. arteriovenous axillary\nfistula or systemic artery pulmonary shunt) is the only option\n(bidirectional Glenn shunt not sufficient or PAP not low enough\nfor this shunt), the benefit of increased pulmonary blood flow\nshould be weighed against increased volume load to the systemic\nventricle.\nFor\ntransplantation,\nprevious\nsternotomies/thoracotomies,\naorto-pulmonary collaterals, and the multisystem nature of cya-\nnotic CHD are technical and medical challenges and limit the\noutcome.\nSpecial considerations and recommendations for inter-\nvention in univentricular heart\nRecommendations\nClassa\nLevelb\nIt is recommended that adults with unoperated\nor palliated UVHs undergo careful evaluation in\nspecialized centres, including multimodality\nimaging as well as invasive work-up to decide\nwhether they may beneﬁt from surgical or inter-\nventional procedures.\nI\nC\nOnly well-selected symptomatic cyanotic\npatients, after careful evaluation [low pulmonary\nvascular resistances, adequate function of the\nAV valve(s), preserved ventricular function],\nshould be considered candidates for a Fontan\ncirculation.\nIIa\nC\nPatients with increased pulmonary blood ﬂow\n\u0002 unlikely at adult age \u0002 should be considered\nfor PA banding or tightening of a previously\nplaced band.\nIIa\nC\nPatients with severe cyanosis and decreased pul-\nmonary blood ﬂow, but without elevated PVR\nor PAP, should be considered for a bidirectional\nGlenn shunt.\nIIa\nC\nPatients with severe cyanosis and decreased pul-\nmonary blood ﬂow not suitable for a Glenn\nshunt may be considered for a systemic-to-PA\nshunt.\nIIb\nC\nHeart transplantation and heart-lung transplan-\ntation should be considered when there is no\nconventional surgical option in patients with\npoor clinical status.\nIIa\nC\nAV = atrioventricular; PA = pulmonary artery; PAP = pulmonary artery pressure;\nPVR = pulmonary vascular resistance; UVH = univentricular heart.\naClass of recommendation.\nbLevel of evidence.\n624\nESC Guidelines\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/6/563/5898606 by guest on 14 January 2026",

Recreational sports can be considered at a\nsymptom-limited level.\n• Pregnancy: contraindicated in patients with severely reduced pul-\nmonary blood flow or with severe PVD, or if ventricular function\nis poor. Cyanosis poses a significant risk to the foetus, with a live\nbirth unlikely (<12%) if oxygen saturation is <85%106 (see section\n3.5.7).\n• For contraception, a combined oral contraceptive pill must be\navoided because of the risk of thrombogenicity and throm-\nboembolism. Progestogen-only pills and progestogen-eluting\nintrauterine devices or implantation systems provide safe contra-\nception with a smaller cardiovascular risk.\n• IE prophylaxis: indicated in all patients (see section 3.4.6).\n4.16 Patients after Fontan operation\n4.16.1\nIntroduction and background\nThe Fontan operation was introduced in 1968 and has become the\ndefinitive treatment for suitable patients with a range of cardiac mal-\nformations characterized by a single functional ventricle (see section\n4.15). Surgery consists of the separation of the systemic and pulmo-\nnary venous returns without a subpulmonary ventricle and restores\nthem to being ‘in series’. Since its introduction, a number of modifica-\ntions have been made to the original procedure, designed to stream-\nline the systemic venous return to the PAs. Currently, the total\ncavopulmonary connection has replaced the atriopulmonary connec-\ntion (RA appendage to PA), with either an intracardiac or extracar-\ndiac conduit between the IVC and the PA, together with an SVC-to-\nPA anastomosis (bidirectional Glenn).301 This circulation is frequently\nestablished in two stages. Adults with HLHS remain a small but\nexpanding group of patients. The first data in adulthood describe a\nconsiderable prevalence of major adverse cardiovascular events and\nit appears that HLHS patients are more prone to complications than\ngeneral\nFontan\npatients,\nwarranting\ncloser\nfollow-up\nand\nassessment.302\nThe natural history and outcome of other palliations for hearts\nwith a ‘single ventricle’ are poor, so that the Fontan is usually\nundertaken in all patients in whom the haemodynamics are suitable.\nIt is now appreciated that the operative mortality and subsequent\noutcome depend on the suitability of the circulation and adherence\nto defined criteria. Strict selection gives the best early and late results,\nwith operative mortality of <5% in modern series and includes low\nPVR and PAP (mean <15 mmHg), preserved ventricular function,\nadequate PA size, no relevant AV valve regurgitation, and normal\nrhythm. A ‘fenestration’ has been performed in selected or all cases\nby some centres to allow for shunting of deoxygenated blood to the\nsystemic circulation at atrial level, aiming to improve the cardiac out-\nput at the expense of cyanosis.303 Fontan operation, when consid-\nered late in adults, is not always the palliation of choice because of\nthe limited long-term outcome.\n4.16.2\nClinical presentation and natural history\nThe lack of a subpulmonary ventricle results in chronic systemic\nvenous hypertension, markedly altered pulmonary haemodynamics,\nand a chronically ‘preload-deprived’ ventricle. A number of important\nproblems have emerged during long-term follow-up. Although 10-\nyear survival may approach 90%, it should be appreciated that a pre-\nmature decline in cardiovascular performance, with reduced survival,\nis inevitable even in the best Fontan patients.304 Important haemody-\nnamic issues contributing to late Fontan failure include a progressive\ndecline in systemic ventricular function, AV valve regurgitation, a rise\nin PVR, atrial enlargement, pulmonary venous obstruction, progres-\nsively restrictive subaortic VSD, and the consequences of chronic\nsystemic venous hypertension including hepatic congestion and dys-\nfunction.305 Further complications include atrial and PA thrombus\nformation, development of pulmonary arteriovenous malformations,\nsystemic arterial-to-pulmonary venous or systemic arterial-to-\npulmonary arterial connection, and systemic-to-pulmonary venous\ncollaterals.\nAfter the Fontan operation, the majority of patients do well during\nchildhood and adolescence, although exercise capacity is reduced\nwhen measured objectively. However, clinical complications may\nsubsequently develop, with a progressive decline in exercise per-\nformance and heart failure, cyanosis, chronic venous insufficiency,\nand development of important arrhythmias, especially in patients\nwith a classical Fontan operation.306 By 10 years after a Fontan opera-\ntion, \u000320% of patients have supraventricular tachyarrhythmias\n(including typically IART and atrial flutter, but also AF and focal\nAT).307 Bradycardia due to SND may facilitate occurrence of AT.\nThe incidence of AT is lower after total cavopulmonary connection\nthan atriopulmonary connection, and lower after extracardiac con-\nduit than intracardiac conduit.308 Atrial tachyarrythmias with rapid\nconduction are associated with SCD.\nThe spectrum of Fontan-associated liver disease is wide and\nincludes both hepatic congestion and severe fibrosis, with signs of\nportal hypertension and hyperenhancing nodules as well as hepato-\ncellular carcinoma.309\nProtein-losing enteropathy is a rare but important complication\nand results in peripheral oedema, pleural effusions, and ascites. It can\nbe diagnosed by documentation of low serum albumin and elevated\nESC Guidelines\n625\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/6/563/5898606 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n....................................................................................................................................................................\na1-antitrypsin levels in the stool.310 It has traditionally been associ-\nated with a very poor prognosis (5-year survival <50%) but a more\nrecent study reported a 5-year survival of 88%; however, treatment\nremains challenging.311 Plastic bronchitis and lymphatic system dys-\nfunction may further complicate prognosis.\nFor more details, see a recently published extensive review.312\n4.16.3\nDiagnostic work-up\nSee section 3.3 for general principles.\nClinical findings include commonly mild, non-pulsatile jugular\nvenous distension. Significant jugular venous distension and hepato-\nmegaly, however, raise suspicion of Fontan obstruction or ventricular\nfailure. ECG frequently shows junctional rhythm or atrial arrhythmias.\nPleural effusion on chest X-ray raises suspicion of protein-losing\nenteropathy.\n• Echocardiography is the first-line diagnostic tool, providing infor-\nmation on ventricular and valve function. To image the Fontan\npathway, TOE or other imaging modalities are generally\nrequired.\n• Annual blood tests should include haematology, serum albumin,\nand liver and renal function. When protein losing enteropathy is\nsuspected, a1-antitrypsin clearance must be calculated.\n• CMR is helpful for evaluation of the Fontan pathway, collaterals,\nand pulmonary veins (e.g. right pulmonary vein obstruction by\nenlarged RA) and for thrombus, all of which CCT can also pro-\nvide. CCT requires experience to mitigate streaming artefact and\nfalse positive diagnosis of thrombus. CMR is regularly performed\nfor ventricular volumes, Fontan pathway patency and flows, to\nevaluate AV valve regurgitation, subaortic obstruction, myocar-\ndial fibrosis, and for detection of thrombus.\n• As liver dysfunction, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma\nhave been recognized as typical complications in this setting, reg-\nular liver imaging (ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic\nresonance) and laboratory assessment should be performed.\n• Cardiac catheterization should be performed at a low threshold\nin cases of unexplained oedema, exercise deterioration, new-\nonset arrhythmia, cyanosis, and haemoptysis. It provides informa-\ntion on ventricular and valvular function, haemodynamics includ-\ning PVR, and Fontan obstruction and anomalous vascular\nconnections (see section 4.16.2). Integration with CMR for flows\n(cardiac output) may allow more precise measurement of PVR.\n4.16.4\nMedical treatment\n• Anticoagulation: right atrial blood stasis and disturbed coagula-\ntion may predispose to thrombosis. The potential for subclinical,\nrecurrent pulmonary embolism (eventually leading to a rise in\nPVR) and systemic embolism have led to a recommendation, by\nsome, for lifelong anticoagulation. There is, however, no evidence\nof benefit, and practice varies between centres. Anticoagulation\nis indicated in the presence, or with a history, of atrial thrombus,\natrial arrhythmias, or thromboembolic events. Although NOACs\nhave been reported to be safe in selected Fontan patients,79\nrobust prospective efficacy data are lacking and thus these drugs\ncannot currently be recommended as standard therapy.\n• Antiarrhythmic therapy: loss of sinus rhythm may precipitate\nrapid haemodynamic decline and atrial arrhythmias. Sustained\natrial arrhythmia with rapid AV conduction should be considered\na medical emergency. Electrical cardioversion is the mainstay of\ntreatment, as drug therapy is often ineffective. Amiodarone may\nbe effective in preventing recurrence, but it has many long-term\nside effects. Sotalol can be an alternative. There should be a low\nthreshold for radiofrequency ablation, although these are difficult\narrhythmias to treat in the catheterization laboratory.313\nAntitachycardia atrial PMs may assist. If AV pacing is required, this\nwill need an epicardial approach. Occurrence of arrhythmias\nshould prompt haemodynamic evaluation. In addition, a proactive\napproach of EP evaluation and ablation therapy (where appropri-\nate) should be considered, including Fontan conversion with con-\ncomitant arrhythmia surgery. ICD therapy may be considered in\nselected patients. See section 3.4.2.\n• Therapy of protein losing enteropathy: medical therapy remains\nchallenging and various treatments have been proposed (after\nexclusion of haemodynamic problems) including salt restriction,\nhigh protein diet, diuretics, ACE inhibitors (may be poorly toler-\nated), steroids, albumin infusion, chronic subcutaneous heparin,\ncreation of a fenestration (by interventional catheter), and even-\ntually, consideration of transplantation.\n• Pulmonary vasodilators: ERAs and PDE-5 inhibitors may be con-\nsidered in selected patients with elevated pulmonary pressure/\nresistance in the absence of elevated ventricular end diastolic\npressure. Data on the routine use of these medications in Fontan\npatients are limited at present. A randomized trial of the ERA\nbosentan has demonstrated significantly improved cardiopulmo-\nnary exercise capacity in 75 adults with Fontan physiology.314\n4.16.5\nSurgical/interventional treatment\nPatients with a ‘failing Fontan’ (with a combination of intractable\narrhythmia, right atrial dilation, worsening AV valve regurgitation,\ndeterioration of ventricular function, and/or atrial thrombus) should\nbe considered for surgery.315 While patients with failing systemic\nventricular function may benefit from heart transplantation (per-\nformed in experienced settings), patients with preserved systemic\nventricular function, atrial arrhythmia, and impaired flow dynamics in\nthe Fontan pathway may benefit from conversion to extracardiac\ntotal cavopulmonary connection and concomitant cryoablation.316\nThe latter has provided good early results in a very experienced set-\nting, but is associated with surgical mortality and ongoing morbidity,\nwith the need for both continued drug therapy and pacemaker\nimplantation in the majority of cases.317 If performed late, conversion\nmay be less likely to result in a good outcome, and cardiac transplan-\ntation may be required. However, the best timing for a conversion\nremains a matter of uncertainty.

The val-\nidity of this classification for clinical management and risk stratifi-\ncation remains to be investigated in large registries.\n• Minimal volumes of patients under care at each ACHD expert\ncentre, and the necessary staff resources for an optimal outcome,\nneed to be defined.\n• Relevant outcome measures, over and above mortality, need to\nbe determined to measure quality of care.\n• The role of neurohormones to estimate disease severity and tim-\ning of interventions is not yet fully established and needs to be\ndefined.\n6.1.2\nHeart failure\n• The pathophysiology/mechanism of heart failure, especially in\nthose with a systemic RV and Fontan circulation, is incompletely\nunderstood and needs further study to find better ways for pre-\nvention and treatment.\n• Indications for application of standard heart failure treatment in\nboth acute and chronic settings need to be better defined.\n• The prediction and course of heart failure needs to be better\ndefined to improve indications and timing of ventricular assist\ndevice/transplantation.\n• Large-scale collaborative international prospective registries on\nmedical and device therapy in ACHD are needed and support\nfor the set up and practical implementation is required.\n6.1.3\nArrhythmia\n• Dedicated scoring systems to assess the indication for anticoagu-\nlation in the setting of atrial arrhythmias are needed for moderate\nand complex CHD.\n• Targeting slow-conducting anatomical isthmuses by catheter\nablation has been highly effective to control monomorphic VT in\nrepaired tetralogy of Fallot. Whether catheter mapping can con-\ntribute to individualized risk stratification in patients without\nspontaneous VTs in repaired tetralogy of Fallot and related\ndefects requires further research.\n• The potential loss of accessibility to slow-conducting anatomical\nisthmuses by catheter ablation after re-valving rTOF and related\ndefects is of concern. Whether patients without documented VT\nbenefit from preventive ablation before or during re-valving\nshould be studied.\n• Indications for pacing and CRT in ACHD patients are mainly\nderived from adults with anatomically normal hearts with ischae-\nmic or dilated cardiomyopathy and are not adapted to the diver-\nsity of structural and functional CHD substrates. The selection of\nCRT candidates, CRT application, and optimal pacing sites for\nthe different CHD substrates requires further research.\n6.1.4\nPulmonary arterial hypertension\n• The impact of medical PAH therapy on survival of patients with\nEisenmenger syndrome requires further study.\n• The role of upfront combination therapy in PAH-CHD requires\nfurther attention.\n• Limited experience is available for prostacyclin therapy in\npatients with PAH-CHD and needs further investigation.\n6.1.5\nCyanotic patients\n• The benefit of routine anticoagulation, in the absence of any\nstrong risk factor for thromboembolic complications (e.g. atrial\narrhythmias), is controversial and requires further study.\n6.2 Specific lesions\n6.2.1\nShunt lesions\n• Late outcome after device closure requires further study, partic-\nularly of arrhythmias.\n• The impact of shunt closure on long-term outcome of patients\nwith PAH remains an area of uncertainty; further research is\nrequired\nto\nbetter\ndefine the\nthresholds\nfor\ntreatment\nrecommendations.\n6.2.2\nLeft ventricular outflow tract obstruction and\ncoarctation\n• The optimal timing of intervention in asymptomatic severe\nLVOTO requires further study.\n• Transcatheter aortic valve implantation is rapidly evolving; its\nrole in ACHD needs further refinement.\n• According to the 2018 ESC Guidelines for the management of\narterial hypertension,190 definitions of hypertension in patients\nwith repaired CoA are the same as in general arterial hyperten-\nsion and patients should be managed according to the general\nguidelines: evidence for this strategy is lacking and prospective\nstudies are required.\n6.2.3\nAortopathies\n• Estimation of the risk for aortic dissection and definition of the\nthreshold for prophylactic surgery in HTAD based on diameter\nalone is suboptimal and calls for a more personalized approach.\nWhether the type of underlying gene defect is helpful in this\nstratification requires further study.\n• Current\nprophylactic\ntreatment\nregimens\nin\nHTAD\npatients include beta blockers and ARBs. Either in monotherapy or\ncombined, neither one prevents further growth of the aorta. The\nsearch for new and better treatment targets should continue.\n6.2.4\nRight ventricular outflow tract obstruction\n• Criteria for concomitant TV repair at the time of RVOT surgery\nrequire refinement.\n• The identification of patients with low-gradient RVOTO who\nhave severe stenosis and would benefit from intervention\nrequires improvement.\n• The criteria for identification of RVOTO patients who would\nbenefit from reintervention for residual PR requires further\nresearch.\n• The role of an EP study for risk stratification for SCD is contro-\nversial in patients with rTOF and needs further study.\nESC Guidelines\n629\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/6/563/5898606 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n.............................................................................................................................................................................\n6.2.5\nEbstein anomaly\n• The identification of asymptomatic Ebstein patients with severe\nTR who would benefit from TV surgery requires further\nimprovement.\n• The identification of Ebstein patients at risk for late life-\nthreatening arrhythmias needs to be improved.\n6.2.6\nTetralogy of Fallot\n• Optimal timing of PVRep for asymptomatic patients with signifi-\ncant PR needs to be further improved.\n• Long-term follow-up studies after TPVI are required to increase\nknowledge about valve durability, consequences of stent frac-\ntures, and occurrence of endocarditis.\n• The identification of rTOF patients at risk for late life-threatening\narrhythmias, who would benefit from ICD implantation as pri-\nmary prevention, needs to be improved.\n• The effect of medical treatment on RV dilatation and/or dysfunc-\ntion in rTOF patients needs to be established.\n6.2.7\nTransposition of the great arteries\n• The potential benefit of classical heart failure medical therapy and\nbiventricular pacing in patients with a systemic RV after an atrial\nswitch procedure requires further study.\n• Risk stratification for SCD and indications for primary ICD\nimplantation after atrial switch require refinement.\n• After an arterial switch procedure, the risk of dissection/rupture\nof neo-aortic root aneurysms requires further study to refine the\nrecommendations for prophylactic surgery.\n• Long-term follow-up after arterial switch is required to study the\nrisk for development of CAD after reimplantation of the coro-\nnary arteries into the neo-aortic root.\n6.2.8\nCongenitally corrected transposition of the great\narteries\n• The definition of optimal timing for TV replacement in patients\nwith severe asymptomatic TR requires more data.\n• The potential benefit of pulmonary banding for the preservation\nof systemic ventricular function requires further study.\n6.2.9\nUniventricular heart and Fontan operation\n• The role of medication, including pulmonary vasodilators, in\nFontan patients is not clear and requires further study.\n• The effects of pregnancy on long-term maternal outcome must\nbe better established.\n• Physiological determinants of long-term outcome in Fontan\npatients, including the role of the lymphatic system, requires\nmore research.\n6.2.10\nCoronary anomalies\n• Identification\nof\nadult\npatients\nwith\ncoronary\nanomalies\n(AAOCA, ACAPA) who are at risk for SCD, and for whom sur-\ngery provides benefit at adult age, requires further research.\n7 Key messages\n7.1 General aspects\n7.1.1\nOrganization of care and patient evaluation\n• Special structural and organizational healthcare requirements are\nnecessary to meet the needs of ACHD patients.\n• Multimodality imaging is key for adequate assessment of overall\nanatomy and ventricular and valvular function, and quantification\nof blood flow, including perfusion distribution.\n• Objective exercise testing is an important tool for determining\nthe timing of interventions and reinterventions.\n• Cardiac catheterization remains key for the assessment of hae-\nmodynamics, in particular, PAP and vascular resistance.\n7.1.2\nHeart failure\n• The key treatment for heart failure in ACHD patients remains its\nprevention by optimizing haemodynamics and heart rhythm. This\nrequires systematic follow-up in specialized centres to facilitate\ntimely intervention.\n• In a biventricular circulation, standard heart failure treatment can\nbe extrapolated to ACHD patients with a systemic LV and may\nbe applied in patients with a systemic RV, although it remains\nuncertain whether the known benefits of treating a failing LV can\nbe expected. Pathophysiology of patients with an atrial switch,\nand especially with a UVH and Fontan palliation, differs markedly\nfrom a ‘regular circulation’ and standard heart failure therapy has\nto be applied cautiously.\n• Timely referral and consultation with ACHD and heart failure\nspecialists in a centre with a transplant service and ACHD exper-\ntise is recommended, especially in those with moderate and\nsevere complexity CHD.\n7.1.3\nArrhythmia\n• In all patients, evaluation for a reversible cause of an arrhythmia\nand for new or residual haemodynamic abnormalities should be\nperformed.\n• Maintenance of sinus rhythm is the aim in most ACHD patients.\n• For optimal chronic arrhythmia management, referral to a centre\nwith a multidisciplinary team and expertise in ACHD-related\narrhythmias is mandatory.\n• Patients with documented arrhythmias or at high risk for post-\nprocedural arrhythmias considered for percutaneous or surgical\n(re)interventions should be discussed in a multidisciplinary team\nwith expertise in interventions and invasive treatment of\narrhythmias.\n7.1.4\nPulmonary arterial hypertension\n• PAH in CHD is a progressive disease with poor prognosis.\n• High suspicion of PAH, and regular assessment for the presence\nof PAH in patients with shunt lesions, after defect closure is\nrecommended.\n• Proactive treatment is required in all PAH patients, including\nthose with Eisenmenger syndrome.\n• Women with CHD and confirmed pre-capillary PH should be\ncounselled against pregnancy.\n630\nESC Guidelines\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/6/563/5898606 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n.............................................................................................................................................................................\n7.1.5\nCyanotic patients\n• Cyanotic patients present with a multisystem disorder and are at\nrisk for both bleeding and thrombotic complications, causing a\ntherapeutic dilemma.\n• Routine phlebotomies must be avoided as they put patients at\nrisk for iron-deficient anaemia and cerebrovascular complica-\ntions. Therapeutic phlebotomy is only indicated in the presence\nof moderate/severe hyperviscosity symptoms.\n• Cyanotic patients have a very balanced, but fragile, pathophysiol-\nogy and any intervention puts the patient at high risk; all interven-\ntions must therefore be performed in an ACHD expert centre.\n• Prophylactic measures are the mainstay of care to prevent and\navoid complications.\n7.2 Specific lesions\n7.2.1\nShunt lesions\n• Treatment decisions require careful evaluation of ventricular vol-\nume overload and pulmonary circulation.\n• In patients with non-invasive signs of elevated PAP, heart cathe-\nterization with assessment of PVR is mandatory.\n• In the presence of PVR >_5 WU, ASD closure should be avoided.\nVSD and PDA closure may only be considered in selected\npatients with significant shunt after careful evaluation in an\nACHD and PH expert centre.\n• Device closure is the treatment of choice when technically\nfeasible.\n7.2.2\nLeft ventricular outflow tract obstruction\n• The strongest indications for surgery remain symptoms and LV\ndysfunction.\n• Exercise testing should be performed in patients with severe\nobstruction who do not report symptoms in order to confirm\nasymptomatic status.\n• In congenital valvular AS, associated aortic disease (ascending\naortic dilatation and/or CoA) needs to be excluded.\n7.2.3\nAortic coarctation\n• Correct blood pressure measurement (right arm, ambulatory) is\nessential in the follow-up of patients with CoA.\n• The decision to (re)intervene depends on blood pressure, gra-\ndient, and stenosis morphology.\n• Stenting is the treatment of choice when technically feasible.\n7.2.4\nAortopathies\n• Lifelong surveillance is essential in all HTAD patients and should\ninclude imaging of the entire aorta, as well as assessment of valvu-\nlar and myocardial function.\n• The aortic diameter at which surgery should be performed\ndepends on the underlying disease and presence of risk factors.\n7.2.5\nRight ventricular outflow tract obstruction\n• RVOTO may be overestimated by the flow velocity across the\nobstruction, particularly when the narrowing is elongated, or\nstenosis is present in series (e.g. subvalvular and valvular).\nTherefore, cross-checking with RV pressure estimated from TR\nvelocity is required.\n• Catheter intervention is the treatment of choice for patients with\nnon-dysplastic valvular PS (balloon valvuloplasty) and with\nperipheral PS (often with stent implantation).\n• The indication for intervention is more restrictive whenever a\nvalve substitute is required because of its long-term implications\nfor complications and requirement for reintervention.\n7.2.6\nEbstein anomaly\n• Timing of surgery remains challenging and this operation should\nonly be performed by surgeons with specific experience in this\nlesion.\n• Valve repair is the preferred technique whenever feasible.\n7.2.7\nTetralogy of Fallot\n• Significant PR and/or RVOTO, RV and LV dysfunction, and\narrhythmias are common long-term complications.\n• Possible risk factors associated with any ventricular arrhythmia\nand SCD in rTOF are QRS duration >180 ms, LV systolic or dia-\nstolic dysfunction, RV dysfunction, inducible VT at programmed\nelectrical stimulation, and history of atrial arrhythmia.\n• The optimal timing for intervention in asymptomatic severe PR\nremains challenging. Normalization of RV size becomes unlikely\nwhen the end diastolic volume index exceeds 160 mL/m2, but\nthis cut-off for reintervention may not correlate with clinical\nbenefit.\n• TPVI has become the treatment of choice for RVOT reinterven-\ntion when anatomically feasible.\n7.2.8\nTransposition of the great arteries\n• Systemic ventricular failure, secondary systemic AV valve regurgi-\ntation, arrhythmia, and baffle stenosis and/or leakage are com-\nmon long-term complications that need to be addressed after\natrial switch operation.\n• Outcome of morbidity has markedly improved with introduction\nof the arterial switch operation. Dilatation of the neo-aortic root\nwith or without significant regurgitation of the neo-aortic valve,\nsupravalvular PS, and pulmonary branch stenosis mostly occur\nduring infancy, but may need reintervention during adulthood.\n• New LV systolic dysfunction and/or arrhythmias after arterial\nswitch require full evaluation, including exclusion of ostial/proxi-\nmal stenoses of the reimplanted coronary arteries.\n• Failure of the RV-to-PA conduit (stenosis, regurgitation, or both)\nis the predominant long-term complication requiring reinterven-\ntion after the Rastelli operation.\n7.2.9\nCongenitally corrected transposition of the great\narteries\n• Systemic RV failure, systemic AV valve regurgitation, AV block,\nand atrial arrhythmia are common late complications.\n• Systemic AV valve regurgitation is an important driver of late out-\ncome and, when severe, should be addressed before systemic\nRV function becomes impaired.\nESC Guidelines\n631\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/6/563/5898606 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n..............................................\n...\n7.2.10\nUniventricular heart and Fontan operation\n• Although quality of life is well preserved in many Fontan patients,\nall require regular intensive follow-up at an ACHD expert centre\nas they are at risk of developing multiple severe complications\nincluding arrhythmia, heart failure, hepatic disease, and protein-\nlosing enteropathy.\n• Low pulmonary artery pressure is mandatory for a good func-\ntioning Fontan circulation and a low threshold for invasive hae-\nmodynamic assessment is recommended when dysfunction is\nsuspected, or complications occur.\n• Arrhythmias are poorly tolerated and require immediate action.\n• Pregnancy is feasible in selected patients with well-functioning\nFontan circulation but there is a high risk of miscarriage and preg-\nnancy should be managed in an ACHD expert centre.\n• Surveillance for liver problems is mandatory in all Fontan\npatients.\n7.2.11\nCoronary anomalies\n• CCT is the preferred technique for the evaluation of high-risk\nanatomy including features such as an intramural course and ori-\nfice anomalies (slit-like orifice, acute-angle take-off, orifice >1 cm\nabove the sinotubular junction).\n• Assessment of stress-induced ischaemia, by means of advanced\nimaging modalities with physical stress, is the key for decision\nmaking.\n• In patients with coronary fistulae, the presence of symptoms,\ncomplications, and a significant shunt are the main indications for\npercutaneous or surgical closure.\n8 ‘What to do’ and ‘what not to do’ messages from the Guidelines\nRecommendations\nClassa\nLevelb\nTreatment of arrhythmias in adult congenital heart disease\nIn patients with moderate and severe CHD complexity (Table 4) and documented arrhythmias,
