In\naddition to these, there are many other relevant risk factors, modi-\nfiers, and clinical conditions, which are addressed under risk modifiers\nand clinical conditions (sections 3.3 and 3.4).\n3.2.1.1 Cholesterol\nThe causal role of LDL-C, and other apo-B-containing lipoproteins,\nin the development of ASCVD is demonstrated beyond any doubt by\ngenetic, observational, and interventional studies.20 The key attrib-\nutes of LDL-C as a risk factor for ASCVD are:\n• Prolonged lower LDL-C is associated with lower risk of ASCVD\nthroughout the range studied, and the results of randomized\ncontrolled trials (RCTs) indicate that lowering LDL-C safely\nreduces CVD risk even at low LDL-C levels [e.g. LDL-C <1.4\nmmol/L (55 mg/dL)].20\n• The relative reduction in CVD risk is proportional to the abso-\nlute size of the change in LDL-C, irrespective of the drug(s) used\nto achieve such change.21\n• The absolute benefit of lowering LDL-C depends on the abso-\nlute risk of ASCVD and the absolute reduction in LDL-C, so\neven a small absolute reduction in LDL-C may be beneficial in a\nhigh- or very-high-risk patient.22\n• Non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) encom-\npasses all atherogenic (apo-B-containing) lipoproteins, and is cal-\nculated as: total cholesterol \u0002 HDL-C = non-HDL-C. The\nrelationship between non-HDL-C and CV risk is at least as\nstrong as the relationship with LDL-C. Non-HDL-C levels con-\ntain, in essence, the same information as a measurement of apo-\nB plasma concentration.23,24 Non-HDL-C is used as an input in\nthe Systemic Coronary Risk Estimation 2 (SCORE2) and\nSCORE2-Older Persons (SCORE2-OP) risk algorithms.\nHDL-C is inversely associated with CVD risk. Very high HDL-C levels\nmay signal an increased CVD risk. There is, however, no evidence\nfrom Mendelian randomization studies, or randomized trials of cho-\nlesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitors, that raising plasma HDL-C\nreduces CVD risk.25\u000228 HDL-C is nonetheless a useful biomarker to\nrefine risk estimation using the SCORE2 algorithms. The SCORE2\nalgorithm cannot be used for patients with a genetic lipid disorder,\nsuch as familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH). Specific LDL-C thresh-\nolds and targets are recommended irrespective of estimated CV risk\nfor patients with FH or other rare/genetic lipid disorders.\n3.2.1.2 Blood pressure\nLongitudinal studies, genetic epidemiological studies, and RCTs have\nshown that raised BP is a major cause of both ASCVD and non-\natherosclerotic CVD [particularly heart failure (HF)], accounting for\n9.4 million deaths and 7% of global disability adjusted life-years.29\nElevated BP is a risk factor for the development of coronary artery\ndisease (CAD), HF, cerebrovascular disease, lower extremity arterial\ndisease (LEAD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and atrial fibrillation\n(AF). The risk of death from either CAD or stroke increases linearly\nfrom BP levels as low as 90 mmHg systolic and 75 mmHg diastolic\nupwards.30,31 The absolute benefit of reducing systolic BP (SBP)\ndepends on absolute risk and the absolute reduction in SBP, except\nthat lower limits of SBP are imposed by tolerability and safety consid-\nerations. Management is determined by the category of hypertension\n(optimal, normal, high-normal, stages 1 to 3, and isolated systolic\nhypertension), defined according to seated office BP, ambulatory BP\nmonitoring (ABPM), or home BP average values (see section\n4.7). Evidence suggests that lifetime BP evolution differs in women\ncompared to men, potentially resulting in an increased CVD risk at\nlower BP thresholds.32\u000234 The SCORE2 algorithm cannot be used\nfor patients with secondary causes and rarer forms of hypertension,\nsuch as primary hyperaldosteronism.\n3.2.1.3 Cigarette smoking\nCigarette smoking is responsible for 50% of all avoidable deaths in\nsmokers, with half of these due to ASCVD. A lifetime smoker has a\n50% probability of dying due to smoking, and on average will lose 10\nyears of life.35 The CVD risk in smokers <50 years of age is five-fold\nhigher than in non-smokers.36 Prolonged smoking is more hazardous\nfor women than for men.37 Worldwide, after high SBP, smoking is\nthe leading risk factor for disability adjusted life-years.38 Second-hand\nsmoke is associated with an increase in CVD risk.39 Some smokeless\ntobacco is also associated with increased risk of CVD.40\nRecommendations for CVD risk assessment\nRecommendations\nClassa\nLevelb\nSystematic global CVD risk assessment is recom-\nmended in individuals with any major vascular\nrisk factor (i.e. family history of premature CVD,\nFH, CVD risk factors such as smoking, arterial\nhypertension, DM, raised lipid level, obesity, or\ncomorbidities increasing CVD risk).\nI\nC\nSystematic or opportunistic CV risk assessment\nin the general population in men >40 years of\nage and in women >50 years of age or postme-\nnopausal with no known ASCVD risk factors\nmay be considered.9\nIIb\nC\nIn those individuals who have undergone CVD\nrisk assessment in the context of opportunistic\nscreening, a repetition of screening after 5 years\n(or sooner if risk was close to treatment thresh-\nolds) may be considered.\nIIb\nC\nOpportunistic screening of BP in adults at risk\nfor the development of hypertension, such as\nthose who are overweight or with a known fam-\nily history of hypertension, should be\nconsidered.19\nIIa\nB\nSystematic CVD risk assessment in men <40\nyears of age and women <50 years of age with\nno known CV risk factors is not recommended.9\nIII\nC\nASCVD = atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; BP = blood pressure; CV = car-\ndiovascular; CVD = cardiovascular disease; DM = diabetes mellitus; FH = familial\nhypercholesterolaemia.\naClass of recommendation.\nbLevel of evidence.\nESC 2021\n3242\nESC Guidelines\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/34/3227/6358713 by guest on 14 January 2026",

A meta-analysis concluded that both BMI\nand waist circumference are similarly, strongly, and continuously\nassociated with ASCVD and type 2 DM.47\n3.2.2. Sex and gender and their impact on health\nThe current prevention guidelines recognize the importance of inte-\ngrating sex, gender, and gender identity considerations into the risk\nassessment and clinical management of individuals and populations.\nThese guidelines also acknowledge the complexity of the inter-\nrelationship between these concepts and CV, as well as psychologi-\ncal, health. There is, at present, no official ESC position on the specific\nterminology\nto\nbe\nused.\nAccording\nto\nthe\nWorld\nHealth\nOrganization (WHO), sex ‘refers to the different biological and phys-\niological characteristics of females, males, and intersex persons, such\nas chromosomes, hormones and reproductive organs’.48\nThis is to be distinguished from gender, which ‘refers to the char-\nacteristics of women, men, girls and boys that are socially con-\nstructed. This includes norms, behaviours and roles associated with\nbeing a woman, man, girl or boy, as well as relationships with each\nother. As a social construct, gender varies from society to society\nand can change over time’.48 The Global Health 50/50 definition fur-\nther states that gender refers ‘to the socially constructed norms that\nimpose and determine roles, relationships, and positional power for\nall people across their lifetime’.49\nWhere evidence exists on the risk modifying effect of sex or\nwhere sex-specific clinical conditions and clinical management strat-\negies exist, this has been included in these guidelines.50 The influence\nof gender on an individual’s experience and access to healthcare is\nparamount.50 The specific health concerns related to gender are thus\nalso acknowledged in these prevention Guidelines.\nEpigenetic effects of social constructs appear to condition the\ntranslation\nof\nbiological\nsex\ninto\ndisease\npathophysiology.\nFurthermore, social constructs can also be determinants of health\naccess, healthcare utilization, disease perception, decision-making,\nand perhaps therapeutic response,50 including in the field of CVD and\nASCVD prevention. Research is ongoing, but gaps in evidence remain\nand this has also been recognized in the guidelines.\nExamples of specific topics regarding physiological, pathological,\nand clinical differences related to sex and gender that have been\nstudied include left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (LVEF), adverse\ndrug reactions, trends in ASCVD risk factors and awareness, sex dis-\nparities in the management of and outcomes after acute coronary\nsyndromes (ACS).51\u000258 Furthermore, CVD health after menopause\ntransition, pregnancy disorders, and gynaecologic conditions have\nrecently been reviewed.59\n3.2.3. Cardiovascular disease risk classification\nThe current guidelines on CVD prevention in clinical practice con-\ncentrate principally, but not exclusively, on risk and prevention of\nASCVD. This includes risk factors, risk prediction, risk modifiers, as\nwell as clinical conditions that often increase the likelihood of\nASCVD.\nIdentifying patients who will benefit most from ASCVD risk factor\ntreatment is central to ASCVD prevention efforts. In general, the\nhigher the absolute CVD risk, the higher the absolute benefit of risk\nfactor treatment, and thus the lower the number needed to treat to\nprevent one CVD event during a period of time.60,61 With this in\nmind, the estimation of CVD risk remains the cornerstone of these\nguidelines and thus appears at the forefront of the proposed manage-\nment schemes, which are summarized in flowcharts.\nAge is the major driver of CVD risk. Women below 50 years and\nmen below 40 years of age are almost invariably at low 10-year CVD\nrisk, but may have unfavourable modifiable risk factors that sharply\nincrease their longer-term CVD risk. Conversely, men over 65 years\nand women over 75 years of age are almost always at high 10-year\nCVD risk. Only between the ages of 55 and 75 years in women and\n40 and 65 years in men does the 10-year CVD risk vary around com-\nmonly used thresholds for intervention. The age categories <50,\n50\u000269, and >_70 years should be used with common sense and flexi-\nbility. Different age ranges may be considered for men and women\nand may differ according to geographic region. Uncertainty around\nrisk estimations should also be considered.\nCVD risk can also be assessed in patients with type 2 DM and in\npatients with established ASCVD. The populations or patient groups\nin whom CVD risk needs to be considered are summarized and pre-\nsented in Table 4. Lifetime CVD risk estimation is available for various\ngroups of patients, and enables estimation of lifetime benefit from\npreventive interventions such as smoking cessation (see section 4.5.1),\nlipid-lowering (see section 4.6.2.1), and BP treatment (see section\n4.7.5.2). Lifetime risk and benefit estimation may be used for commu-\nnication in the shared decision-making process, together with consid-\neration of comorbidities, frailty, patient preferences for initiating\n(STEP 1) and intensifying (STEP 2) risk factor treatment (Figure 2).\n3.2.3.1 A stepwise approach to risk factor treatment and treatment\nintensification\nAs explained before, targets and goals for LDL-C, BP, and glycaemic\ncontrol in DM remain as recommended in recent ESC Guidelines.3\u00025\nThese guidelines propose a stepwise approach to treatment intensifi-\ncation as a tool to help physicians and patients pursue these targets in\na way that fits patient profiles and preferences. This principle (out-\nlined in Figure 2, using the example of a stepwise approach) is not\nconceptually novel, but rather reflects routine clinical practice, in\nwhich treatment strategies are initiated and then intensified, both as\npart of a shared decision-making process involving healthcare profes-\nsionals and patients.\nESC Guidelines\n3243\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/34/3227/6358713 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\nTable 4\nPatient categories and associated cardiovascular disease risk.\nPatient category\nSubgroups\nRisk \ncategories\nApparently healthy persons\nPersons without established \nASCVD, diabetes mellitus, CKD, \nFamilial Hypercholesterolemia\n<50 years\nLow- to\nhigh-risk\n10-year CVD risk estimation (SCORE2).

This is followed by CVD risk stratification and discussion\nof potential benefits of treatment with the patient. If treatment is initi-\nated, its effect must be evaluated, and subsequent treatment intensifi-\ncation to reach ultimate risk factor goals must be considered in all\npatients, taking into account additional benefit, comorbidities, and\nfrailty, all of which converge with patient preferences in a shared\ndecision-making process.\nIn the field of DM, studies have shown benefit of a stepwise\napproach to treatment intensification and do not support the conten-\ntion of ‘therapeutic nihilism’ occurring in either physicians or patients.\nIn fact, it appears that attainment of treatment goals is similar, side-\neffects are fewer, and patient satisfaction is significantly higher with\nsuch an approach.66,67 We do, however, emphasize that stopping\nassessment of treatment goals and/or treatment routinely after the\nfirst step is inappropriate. The evidence-based ultimate targets of\ntreatment intensification are optimal from the perspective of CVD\nrisk reduction and are to be considered in all patients.\n3.2.3.2 Risk estimation in apparently healthy people\nApparently healthy people are those without established ASCVD,\ntype 2 DM, or severe comorbidities. In the 2016 ESC prevention\nguidelines,2 the Systemic Coronary Risk Estimation (SCORE) algo-\nrithm was used to estimate 10-year risk of CVD death. However,\nCVD morbidity (non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke)\ncombined with CVD mortality better reflects the total burden of\nASCVD. The updated SCORE algorithm—SCORE2—used in these\nguidelines (see Figure 3), estimates an individual’s 10-year risk of fatal\nand non-fatal CVD events (myocardial infarction, stroke) in appa-\nrently healthy people aged 40\u000269 years with risk factors that are\nuntreated or have been stable for several years.68\nSeveral specific considerations apply to CVD risk estimation in\nolder people. First, the gradient of the relationship between classical\nrisk factors, such as lipids and BP, with CVD risk attenuates with\nage.69 Second, CVD-free survival dissociates from overall survival\nprogressively with increasing age, because risk for non-CVD mortal-\nity increases (‘competing risk’).70 For these reasons, traditional risk\nCategories of individuals considered for prevention\nSTEP 1\n10-year CVD risk\nLifetime CVD risk\nand treatment benefit\nComorbidities\nPatient preferences\nIntensified prevention and\ntreatment goals based on:\nApparently healthy\npersons\n(See Figure 6)\nSTEP 2\nPatients with\nestablished ASCVD\n(See Figure 7)\nPatients with\ntype 2 diabetes mellitus\n(See Figure 8)\nPatients with specific risk\nfactors such as CKD\nand FH (See Table 4)\nPrevention goals for all\nPrevention goals for all\nPrevention goals for all\nSpecific risk factor\nprevention and\ntreatment goals\nbased on\nrisk categories\nEstimate 10-year\nCVD risk\nConsider risk modifiers,\nlifetime CVD risk,\ntreatment benefit and\npatient preferences\nPrevention goals\nUltimate prevention goals\nPrevention goals based\non whether patients are\nwithout or with\nestablished ASCVD\nand/or severe TOD\n10-year CVD risk\nLifetime CVD risk\nand treatment benefit\nComorbidities\nPatient preferences\nIntensified prevention and\ntreatment goals based on:\nUltimate prevention goals\n10-year CVD risk\nLifetime CVD risk\nand treatment benefit\nComorbidities\nPatient preferences\nIntensified prevention and\ntreatment goals based on:\nUltimate prevention goals\nFigure 2 Examples of a stepwise approach to risk stratification and treatment options.

risk of CVD,\nand hence overestimate the potential benefit of treatment.71 The\nSCORE2-OP algorithm estimates 5-year and 10-year fatal and non-\nfatal CVD events (myocardial infarction, stroke) adjusted for compet-\ning risks in apparently healthy people aged >_70 years.72\nSCORE2 and SCORE2-OP are calibrated to four clusters of coun-\ntries (low, moderate, high, and very high CVD risk) that are grouped\nbased on national CVD mortality rates published by the WHO\n(Supplementary Table 3 and Figure 4).73 Low-risk countries:\nBelgium, Denmark, France, Israel, Luxembourg, Norway, Spain,\nSwitzerland,\nthe Netherlands, and the United Kingdom (UK).\nModerate-risk countries: Austria, Cyprus, Finland, Germany,\nGreece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Malta, Portugal, San Marino, Slovenia,\nand\nSweden.\nHigh-risk\ncountries:\nAlbania,\nBosnia\nand\nHerzegovina, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Kazakhstan,\nPoland, Slovakia, and Turkey. Very high-risk countries: Algeria,\nArmenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bulgaria, Egypt, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan,\nLatvia, Lebanon, Libya, Lithuania, Montenegro, Morocco, Republic of\nMoldova, Romania, Russian Federation, Serbia, Syria, The Former\nYugoslav Republic (Macedonia), Tunisia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan. A\nmultiplier approach has been used for converting CVD mortality\nrates to fatal and non-fatal CVD events.74 The SCORE2 algorithm\ncan be accessed in the ESC CVD Risk app (freely available from app\nstores) and in risk charts for the four clusters of countries (Figure 4).\nThe SCORE2 charts do not apply to persons with documented CVD\nor other high-risk conditions such as DM, FH, or other genetic or\nrare lipid or BP disorders, CKD, and in pregnant women.\nTo estimate a person’s 10-year risk of total CVD events, one must\nfirst identify the correct cluster of countries and the accompanying\nrisk table for their sex, smoking status, and (nearest) age. Within that\ntable, one then finds the cell nearest to the person’s BP and non-\nHDL-C. Risk estimates then need to be adjusted upwards as the per-\nson approaches the next age category.\n3.2.3.3 Translating cardiovascular disease risk to treatment thresholds\nWhile no risk threshold is universally applicable, the intensity of treat-\nment should increase with increasing CVD risk. In individual cases,\nhowever, no lower threshold of total CVD risk precludes treatment\nof risk factors. Conversely, no high threshold for total CVD risk\nimplies ‘mandatory’ treatment. Across the entire range of CVD risk,\nthe decision to initiate interventions remains a matter of individual\nconsideration and shared decision-making (see also section 4.1). In\ngeneral, risk factor treatment recommendations are based on\nHigh risk\nModerate risk\nVery high risk\nLow risk\nFigure 4 Risk regions based on World Health Organization cardiovascular mortality rates.68,72,73\n3250\nESC Guidelines\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/34/3227/6358713 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n..........................................................................\ncategories of CVD risk (‘low-to-moderate’, ‘high’, and ‘very high’).\nThe cut-off risk levels for these categories are numerically different\nfor various age groups to avoid undertreatment in the young and to\navoid overtreatment in older persons. As age is a major driver of\nCVD risk, but lifelong risk factor treatment benefit is higher in\nyounger people, the risk thresholds for considering treatment are\nlower for younger people (Table 5).\nRisk categories do not ‘automatically’ translate into recommenda-\ntions for starting drug treatment. In all age groups, consideration of\nrisk modifiers, lifetime CVD risk, treatment benefit, comorbidities,\nfrailty, and patient preferences may further guide treatment\ndecisions.\nAlso, note that many patients can move themselves towards a\nlower risk category without taking drugs just by stopping smoking.\nFinally, note that persons >_70 years old may be at very high risk whilst\nbeing at target SBP, and primary prevention with lipid-lowering drugs\nin older persons is a Class IIb (‘may consider’) recommendation; see\nsection 4.6.\nIn the 50\u000269-year age range, a 10-year CVD mortality risk thresh-\nold of 5% estimated with the previously used SCORE algorithm cor-\nresponds, on average, to a 10-year fatal and non-fatal CVD risk\nthreshold of 10% estimated with SCORE2, as approximately the\nsame number of people are above the risk threshold and would qual-\nify for treatment.68\nTable 5\nCardiovascular disease risk categories based on\nSCORE2 and SCORE2-OP in apparently healthy people\naccording to age\n<50 years\n50\u000269\nyears\n\u000370 yearsa\nLow-to-moderate CVD\nrisk: risk factor treatment gen-\nerally not recommended\n<2.5%\n<5%\n<7.5%\nHigh CVD risk: risk factor\ntreatment should be\nconsidered\n2.5 to <7.5% 5 to <10%\n7.5 to <15%\nVery high CVD risk: risk fac-\ntor treatment generally\nrecommendeda\n>_7.5%\n>_10%\n>_15%\nCVD = cardiovascular disease.\naIn apparently healthy people >_70 years old, the treatment recommendation for\nlipid-lowering drugs is Class IIb (‘may be considered’).\nThe division of the population into three distinct age groups (<50, 50\u000269, and\n>_70 years) results in a discontinuous increase in risk thresholds for low-to-mod-\nerate, high, and very high risk. In reality, age is obviously continuous, and a sensi-\nble application of the thresholds in clinical practice would require some ﬂexibility\nin handling these risk thresholds as patients move towards the next age group, or\nrecently passed the age cut-off. Figure 5 illustrates how a continuous increase in\nage relates to increasing risk thresholds, and may be used as a guide for daily\npractice.\nESC 2021\n30\n25\n22.5\n20\n17.5\n15\n12.5\n10\n7.5\n5\n2.5\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\nAge groups (years)\n50-69\n<50\n≥70\n10-year CVD risk (%)\nCVD risk thresholds (%)\nVery high CVD risk\nHigh CVD risk\nLow-to-moderate CVD risk\nFigure 5 Schematic representation of increasing 10-year cardiovascular disease risk thresholds across age groups.

Also, lifetime benefit of\ntreatment in terms of time gained free of CVD is lower in older peo-\nple. Therefore, the CVD risk thresholds for risk factor treatment are\nhigher in apparently healthy people >_70 years. A 10-year CVD risk\n>15% is generally considered ‘very high risk’, and treatment of\nASCVD risk factors is recommended (note: the recommendation for\nlipid-lowering treatment in apparently healthy people >_70 years is\nclass IIb; ‘may be considered’; see section 4.6). A 10-year CVD risk of\n7.5 to <15% is considered ‘high risk’, and treatment of risk factors\nshould be considered taking CVD risk modifiers, frailty, lifetime treat-\nment benefit (in low and moderate risk regions, Box 1), comorbid-\nities, polypharmacy, and patient preferences into account. Given the\nsubjective nature of many of these factors, it is not possible to define\nstrict criteria for these considerations. A 10-year CVD risk <7.5% is\nconsidered ‘low-to-moderate risk’, and would generally not qualify\nfor risk factor treatment unless one or several risk modifiers (section\n3.3) increase risk or the estimated lifetime risk and treatment benefit\nis considered substantial.75\u000279\n3.2.3.6 Risk estimation and risk factor treatment in apparently healthy\npeople <50 years of age\nStopping smoking, lifestyle recommendations, and SBP <160 mmHg are\nrecommended for all (Figure 6). The 10-year CVD risk in relatively\nyoung, apparently healthy people is on average low, even in the pres-\nence of high risk factor levels, but the lifetime CVD risk is in these cir-\ncumstances very high. In apparently healthy people <50 years of age, a\n10-year CVD risk >_7.5% is generally considered ‘very high risk’ as this\nrisk relates to a high lifetime risk, and treatment of ASCVD risk factors\nis recommended. A 10-year CVD risk of 2.5 to <7.5% is considered\n‘high risk’, and treatment of risk factors should be considered, taking\nCVD risk modifiers, lifetime risk and treatment benefit (in low- and\nmoderate-risk regions), and patient preferences into account. A 10-\nyear CVD risk <2.5% is considered ‘low-to-moderate risk’, and would\ngenerally not qualify for risk factor treatment unless one or several risk\nmodifiers (see section 3.3) increase risk or the estimated lifetime risk and\ntreatment benefit is considered substantial (see Box 1) (Figure 6).75\u000278\nIn risk communication with younger people, the lifetime benefit\nperspective may be useful, as well as discussing the potential of avoid-\ning a devastating CVD event in the short-to-intermediate term,\ndespite the fact that 10-year CVD risk may be very low.\nCVD risk predictions, as well as predictions of lifetime benefit of\nrisk factor treatment, are likely to be imprecise at very young age\n(<40 years). At that age, lipid-lowering and BP-lowering drug treat-\nment are not usually considered, except for patients with FH or spe-\ncific BP disorders. A healthy lifestyle that is maintained throughout\nlife is more relevant for the very young. Mendelian randomization\nstudies illustrate very nicely that relatively small differences in LDL-C\nor SBP maintained throughout life have large implications on CVD\nrisk over a lifespan.80\n3.2.3.7 Risk estimation and risk factor treatment in patients with estab-\nlished atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease\nPatients with clinically established ASCVD are, on average, at very\nhigh risk of recurrent CVD events if risk factors are not treated.\nTherefore, smoking cessation, adoption of a healthy lifestyle, and risk\nfactor treatment is recommended in all patients (STEP 1). Further\nintensification of risk factor treatment by aiming at lower treatment\ngoals (STEP 2) is beneficial in most patients and must be considered,\ntaking 10-year CVD risk, comorbidities, lifetime risk and treatment\nbenefit (Box 1), frailty, and patient preferences into account in a\nshared decision-making process (Figure 7).\nAfter initial risk factor treatment and the achievement of risk\nfactor treatment goals, the individual residual risk for recurrent\nBox 1. Lifetime CVD risk and treatment benefit estimation\nPrevention of CVD by treating risk factors is usually done with a lifetime perspective. Lifetime CVD risk can be approximated by clinical expe-\nrience with clinical criteria such as age, (change in) risk factor levels, risk modifiers, etc. or estimated in apparently healthy people, patients\nwith established ASCVD, and persons with type 2 DM with specific lifetime CVD risk scores.75\u000277 Lifetime benefit from risk factor manage-\nment can be estimated by combining lifetime risk models with HRs derived from RCTs, meta-analyses of RCTs, or Mendelian randomization\nstudies, which may provide estimates of the effects of longer-term treatment of risk factors. Online calculators (such as the ESC CVD Risk\napp) can be used to estimate the average lifetime benefit of smoking cessation (see also Figure 11), lipid lowering (see also Figure 12), and BP\nlowering (see also Figure 15) on an individual patient level expressed as extra CVD-free life-years.78 Average lifetime benefit is easy to interpret\nand may improve the communication of potential therapy benefits to patients in a shared decision-making process. This may in turn increase\npatient engagement, self-efficacy, and motivation to adhere to lifestyle changes and drug treatment.\nThe lifetime risk is an estimate of the age at which there is a 50% probability that a person will either have experienced a CVD event or have\ndied. Lifetime benefit is the numerical difference between the predicted age at which there is a 50% probability that a person will either have\nexperienced a CVD event or have died with and without a proposed treatment. Currently there are no formal treatment thresholds for aver-\nage lifetime benefit. In addition, the estimated individual lifetime benefit should be viewed in the light of the estimated duration of treatment.\nDuration of lifelong treatment will generally be longer in young persons compared to older people. Both treatment effect and treatment dura-\ntion determine the individual ‘return on investment’ of risk factor treatment. In a shared decision-making process between healthcare provider\nand patient, the minimum desired benefit of a certain treatment needs to be established, a process in which patient preference, expected\ntreatment harms, and costs can be taken into account.\nBP = blood pressure; CVD = cardiovascular disease; DM = diabetes mellitus; ESC = European Society of Cardiology; HR = hazard ratio;\nRCT = randomized controlled trial.\n3254\nESC Guidelines\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/34/3227/6358713 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\nHighb\nModerateb\nEstablished ASCVD or severe TODa\nPatients with type 2 diabetes mellitus\nAND\nStop smoking and lifestyle recommendations (Class I)\nHbA1c: <53 mmol/mol (<7.0%) (Class I)\nSTEP 1\nRisk\nResidual 10-year CVD risk\nLifetime CVD risk and treatment benefitd\nComorbidities, frailty\nPatient preferences\nIntensified treatment based on:\nSBP\n<130 mmHg\nif tolerated\n(Class I)\nSGLT2-i or GLP-1RA\nif not already on itc\n(Class I)\nLDL-C\n<1.4 mmol/L\n(<55 mg/dL)\n(Class I)\nDAPT, DPI,\nnovel upcoming\ninterventions\n(e.g. colchicine,\nEPA)\n(Class IIb)\n10-year CVD risk\nLifetime CVD risk and treatment benefitd\nComorbidities, frailty\nPatient preferences\nIntensified treatment based on:\nSBP\n<130 mmHg\nif tolerated\n(Class I)\nSGLT2-i or GLP-1RA\nif not already on it\n(Class IIb)\nLDL-C\n<1.8 mmol/L\n(<70 mg/dL)\n(Class I)\nSBP <140 to\n130 mmHg\nif tolerated\n(Class I)\nLDL-C \n≥50% reduction and\n<1.8 mmol/L \n(<70 mg/dL)\n(Class I)\nAntithrombotic\ntherapy\n(Class I)\nSGLT2-i or GLP-1RA...c\n… for TOD: Class IIb\n… for CVD: Class I\nSBP <140 to\n130 mmHg\nif tolerated\n(Class I)\nLDL-C \n<2.6 mmol/\n(<100 mg/dL)\n(Class I)\nAdditional\nprevention\ngoals\ngenerally not\nrecommended\n(Class III)\nSTEP 2\nWithout\nWith\nFigure 8 Flow chart of cardiovascular risk and risk factor treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

See Box 1.\nESC Guidelines\n3255\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/34/3227/6358713 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\nCVD varies widely and should be considered.81 It is evident that\npatients with a recent ACS or progressive vascular disease, and\npatients with DM and vascular disease, are all at exceptionally high\nrisk for recurrent CVD events. For other patients with established\nASCVD, the residual risk may be less evident and could be esti-\nmated based on clinical criteria such as age, (change in) risk factor\nlevels, and risk modifiers, or by calculation of residual CVD risk\nwith a calculator.\nThe risk of recurrent CVD is influenced mainly by classical risk fac-\ntors, vascular disease site, and kidney function. Risk stratification tools\nfor\nsecondary\nprevention\ninclude\nthe\nSMART\n(Secondary\nManifestations of Arterial Disease) risk score (available in the ESC\nCVD Risk app) for estimating 10-year residual CVD risk in patients\nwith stable ASCVD, defined as CAD, PAD, or cerebrovascular dis-\nease,81 and the European Action on Secondary and Primary\nPrevention by Intervention to Reduce Events (EUROASPIRE) risk\nmodel, which estimates 2-year risk of recurrent CVD in patients with\nstable CAD.82\nOccasionally, recurrent CVD risk is very high despite maximum\n(tolerated) conventional treatments. In such cases, novel but less\nwell-established preventive treatments such as dual antithrombotic\npathway inhibition,83 icosapent ethyl,84 or anti-inflammatory therapy\nwith colchicine (see section 4.10)85,86 may be considered.\n3.2.3.8 Risk estimation and risk factor treatment in persons with type 2\ndiabetes mellitus\nMost adults with type 2 DM are at high or very high risk for future\nCVD, particularly from middle age onwards. On average, type 2 DM\ndoubles CVD risk and reduces life expectancy by 4 - 6 years, with\nabsolute risks highest in those with any target organ damage (TOD).\nType 2 DM also increases the risk for cardiorenal outcomes, in par-\nticular HF and CKD. Relative risks (RRs) for CVD in type 2 DM are\nhigher at younger ages of onset and are modestly higher in women\ncompared with men.87 Smoking cessation and adoption of a healthy\nlifestyle are recommended for all people with type 2 DM, and risk fac-\ntor treatment should be considered in all people with DM, at least\nthose above the age of 40 years (see sections 4.6 and 4.7). Still, there\nis a wide range in individual risk for CVD events, especially after initial\nrisk factor management.88\nPersons with DM with severe TOD (for definition: see Table 4)\ncan be considered to be at very high CVD risk, similar to people with\nestablished CVD (see Table 4). Most others with DM are considered\nto be at high ASCVD risk.64 However, an exception can be made for\npatients with well-controlled short-standing DM (e.g. <10 years), no\nevidence of TOD, and no additional ASCVD risk factors, who may\nbe considered as being at moderate CVD risk.\nIn addition to the semi-quantitative division into three risk catego-\nries described above, DM-specific risk models may refine risk esti-\nmates and illustrate the impact of treatments. These models\ngenerally include duration of DM, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c)\nlevel, and presence of TOD. Examples are the ADVANCE (Action in\nDiabetes and Vascular disease: preterAx and diamicroN-MR\nControlled Evaluation) risk score, which predicts 10-year CVD risk,\nand the UKPDS (UK Prospective Diabetes Study) risk engine, which\npredicts fatal and non-fatal CVD risk and is available for use in the\nUK.

      "content": "CVD varies widely and should be considered.81 It is evident that\npatients with a recent ACS or progressive vascular disease, and\npatients with DM and vascular disease, are all at exceptionally high\nrisk for recurrent CVD events. For other patients with established\nASCVD, the residual risk may be less evident and could be esti-\nmated based on clinical criteria such as age, (change in) risk factor\nlevels, and risk modifiers, or by calculation of residual CVD risk\nwith a calculator.\nThe risk of recurrent CVD is influenced mainly by classical risk fac-\ntors, vascular disease site, and kidney function. Risk stratification tools\nfor\nsecondary\nprevention\ninclude\nthe\nSMART\n(Secondary\nManifestations of Arterial Disease) risk score (available in the ESC\nCVD Risk app) for estimating 10-year residual CVD risk in patients\nwith stable ASCVD, defined as CAD, PAD, or cerebrovascular dis-\nease,81 and the European Action on Secondary and Primary\nPrevention by Intervention to Reduce Events (EUROASPIRE) risk\nmodel, which estimates 2-year risk of recurrent CVD in patients with\nstable CAD.82\nOccasionally, recurrent CVD risk is very high despite maximum\n(tolerated) conventional treatments. In such cases, novel but less\nwell-established preventive treatments such as dual antithrombotic\npathway inhibition,83 icosapent ethyl,84 or anti-inflammatory therapy\nwith colchicine (see section 4.10)85,86 may be considered.\n3.2.3.8 Risk estimation and risk factor treatment in persons with type 2\ndiabetes mellitus\nMost adults with type 2 DM are at high or very high risk for future\nCVD, particularly from middle age onwards. On average, type 2 DM\ndoubles CVD risk and reduces life expectancy by 4 - 6 years, with\nabsolute risks highest in those with any target organ damage (TOD).\nType 2 DM also increases the risk for cardiorenal outcomes, in par-\nticular HF and CKD. Relative risks (RRs) for CVD in type 2 DM are\nhigher at younger ages of onset and are modestly higher in women\ncompared with men.87 Smoking cessation and adoption of a healthy\nlifestyle are recommended for all people with type 2 DM, and risk fac-\ntor treatment should be considered in all people with DM, at least\nthose above the age of 40 years (see sections 4.6 and 4.7). Still, there\nis a wide range in individual risk for CVD events, especially after initial\nrisk factor management.88\nPersons with DM with severe TOD (for definition: see Table 4)\ncan be considered to be at very high CVD risk, similar to people with\nestablished CVD (see Table 4). Most others with DM are considered\nto be at high ASCVD risk.64 However, an exception can be made for\npatients with well-controlled short-standing DM (e.g. <10 years), no\nevidence of TOD, and no additional ASCVD risk factors, who may\nbe considered as being at moderate CVD risk.\nIn addition to the semi-quantitative division into three risk catego-\nries described above, DM-specific risk models may refine risk esti-\nmates and illustrate the impact of treatments. These models\ngenerally include duration of DM, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c)\nlevel, and presence of TOD. Examples are the ADVANCE (Action in\nDiabetes and Vascular disease: preterAx and diamicroN-MR\nControlled Evaluation) risk score, which predicts 10-year CVD risk,\nand the UKPDS (UK Prospective Diabetes Study) risk engine, which\npredicts fatal and non-fatal CVD risk and is available for use in the\nUK.

Communication of cardiovascular disease risk\nReducing CVD risk at the individual level begins with appropriate\nassessment of individual risk and effective communication of risk and\nanticipated risk reduction by risk factor treatment. Patient-doctor\ninteractions are complex and communicating risk is challenging.94,95\nThere is no single ‘correct’ approach; rather, it will depend on the\nindividual’s preferences and understanding, which may differ with\neducation status and numeracy. Risk perception is also strongly\naffected by emotional factors such as fear, optimism, etc. (‘patients\ndon’t think risk, they feel risk’).96\nIt is important to explore whether patients understand their risk,\nthe anticipated risk reduction, and the pros and cons of intervention,\nand to identify what is important to them. For example, one patient\nmay focus on living free of medications, whereas another may be less\nable to change their lifestyle. In terms of outcomes, reducing mortal-\nity risk is crucial to some, whereas disease risk is more important to\nothers. Short-term risk may motivate some patients, whereas lifetime\nbenefit (see Box 1) will have more impact in others. In general, visual\naids (graphs etc.) improve risk understanding, absolute risk (reduc-\ntion) is better understood than RR (reduction), and the use of ‘num-\nbers needed to treat’ is less well understood.\nIn apparently healthy people, the standard approach is to report\nabsolute 10-year risk of a CVD event with SCORE2 or SCORE2-OP,\nwhich can be found at the ESC CVD Risk Calculator app (https://\nwww.escardio.org/Education/ESC-Prevention-of-CVD-Programme/\nRisk-assessment/esc-cvd-risk-calculation-app)\nor\nat\nhttp://\nwww.heartscore.org or https://www.u-prevent.com. In specific situa-\ntions, one may opt for expressing risk in terms other than absolute\n10-year risk. Examples of such situations include risks in young or\nvery old people. In young people, lifetime risk might be more infor-\nmative, as 10-year CVD risk is usually low even in the presence of\nrisk factors. In older persons, specific risk estimation is required, tak-\ning competing non-CVD mortality into account.78 Direct translation\nof RRs to treatment decisions is not recommended, as absolute risk\nremains the key criterion for starting treatment.\nAn alternative way of expressing individual risk is to calculate a per-\nson’s ‘risk age’.96 The risk age of a person with several ASCVD risk\nfactors is the age of a person of the same sex with the same level of\nrisk but with low levels of risk factors. Risk age is an intuitive and easily\nunderstood way of illustrating the likely reduction in life expectancy\nthat a young person with a low absolute but high RR of CVD will be\nexposed to if preventive measures are not adopted.

Risk perception is also strongly\naffected by emotional factors such as fear, optimism, etc. (‘patients\ndon’t think risk, they feel risk’).96\nIt is important to explore whether patients understand their risk,\nthe anticipated risk reduction, and the pros and cons of intervention,\nand to identify what is important to them. For example, one patient\nmay focus on living free of medications, whereas another may be less\nable to change their lifestyle. In terms of outcomes, reducing mortal-\nity risk is crucial to some, whereas disease risk is more important to\nothers. Short-term risk may motivate some patients, whereas lifetime\nbenefit (see Box 1) will have more impact in others. In general, visual\naids (graphs etc.) improve risk understanding, absolute risk (reduc-\ntion) is better understood than RR (reduction), and the use of ‘num-\nbers needed to treat’ is less well understood.\nIn apparently healthy people, the standard approach is to report\nabsolute 10-year risk of a CVD event with SCORE2 or SCORE2-OP,\nwhich can be found at the ESC CVD Risk Calculator app (https://\nwww.escardio.org/Education/ESC-Prevention-of-CVD-Programme/\nRisk-assessment/esc-cvd-risk-calculation-app)\nor\nat\nhttp://\nwww.heartscore.org or https://www.u-prevent.com.

Patient-doctor\ninteractions are complex and communicating risk is challenging.94,95\nThere is no single ‘correct’ approach; rather, it will depend on the\nindividual’s preferences and understanding, which may differ with\neducation status and numeracy. Risk perception is also strongly\naffected by emotional factors such as fear, optimism, etc. (‘patients\ndon’t think risk, they feel risk’).96\nIt is important to explore whether patients understand their risk,\nthe anticipated risk reduction, and the pros and cons of intervention,\nand to identify what is important to them. For example, one patient\nmay focus on living free of medications, whereas another may be less\nable to change their lifestyle. In terms of outcomes, reducing mortal-\nity risk is crucial to some, whereas disease risk is more important to\nothers. Short-term risk may motivate some patients, whereas lifetime\nbenefit (see Box 1) will have more impact in others.

Potential risk modifiers\nApart from the conventional CVD risk factors included in the risk\ncharts, additional risk factors or types of individual information can\nalso modify calculated risk. Assessment of a potential modifier may\nbe considered if:\n• It improves measures of risk prediction, such as discrimination or\nreclassification (e.g. by calculation of net reclassification index)\n• Public health impact is clear (e.g. number needed to screen or\nnet benefit)\n• It is feasible in daily practice\n• Information is not just available on how risk increases with an\nunfavourable result, but also on how risk decreases if the modi-\nfier shows a favourable result\n• The literature on this potential modifier is not distorted by publi-\ncation bias.\nVery few potential modifiers meet all of these criteria. Meta-\nanalyses in this field are, for example, susceptible to substantial publi-\ncation bias.106 Also, the exact way of integrating additional informa-\ntion on top of regular risk calculator input parameters is mostly\nunknown. Finally, RCTs to determine whether the added risk infor-\nmation eventually leads to improved health outcomes are generally\nlacking.\nAssessment of potential risk modifiers seems particularly relevant if\nthe individual’s risk is close to a decision threshold. In low-risk or\nvery-high-risk situations, additional information is less likely to alter\nmanagement decisions. The number of individuals in this ‘grey zone’ is\nlarge. Therefore, feasibility becomes a limitation as modifiers become\nmore complex or expensive, such as some imaging techniques.\nCare should be taken not to use risk modifiers solely to increase\nrisk estimates when the modifier profile is unfavourable, but also vice\nversa. Although an unfavourable risk modifier may increase an indi-\nvidual’s estimated risk, a more favourable profile than would be\nexpected based on other patient characteristics must have the oppo-\nsite effect. Finally, it is important to acknowledge that the degree to\nwhich calculated absolute risk is affected by modifiers is generally\nmuch smaller than the (independent) RRs reported for these modi-\nfiers in the literature.107\nTaking the above into account, we summarize the literature on\nseveral popular risk modifiers in this section.\n3.3.1. Psychosocial factors\nPsychosocial stress is associated, in a dose-response pattern, with the\ndevelopment and progression of ASCVD, independently of conven-\ntional risk factors and sex. Psychosocial stress includes stress symptoms\n(i.e. symptoms of mental disorders), as well as stressors such as loneli-\nness and critical life events. The RRs of psychosocial stress are com-\nmonly between 1.2 and 2.0108,109 (Supplementary Table 4). Conversely,\nindicators of mental health, such as optimism and a strong sense of pur-\npose, are associated with lower risk.109 Psychosocial stress has direct\nbiological effects, but is also highly correlated with socioeconomic and\nbehavioural risk factors (e.g. smoking, poor adherence).100,109\u0002113\nAlthough the associations of psychosocial stress with CV health are\nrobust, only ‘vital exhaustion’ has been proven to improve risk reclassi-\nfication.101 Owing to the importance of stress symptoms among\nASCVD patients, several guidelines and scientific statements recom-\nmend screening of ASCVD patients for psychological stress113\u0002115\n(Box 2 and Supplementary Table 5). A recent prospective cohort study\nwith a median follow-up of 8.4 years reported favourable effects of\nscreening for depression on major ASCVD events.102\n3.3.2. Ethnicity\nEurope includes many citizens whose ethnic background originates in\ncountries such as India, China, North Africa, and Pakistan. Given the\nconsiderable variability in ASCVD risk factors between immigrant\ngroups, no single CVD risk score performs adequately in all groups.\nRather, the use of a multiplying factor would be helpful to take\naccount of CVD risk imposed by ethnicity independent of other risk\nfactors in the risk score. The most contemporary relevant data come\nfrom the QRISK3 findings in the UK,105 although this focuses on a\nwider range of CVD outcomes and not simply on CVD mortality.\nImmigrants from South Asia (notably India and Pakistan) present\nhigher CVD rates independent of other risk factors, whereas\nadjusted CVD risks appear lower in most other ethnic groups. The\nreasons for such differences remain inadequately studied, as do the\nrisks associated with other ethnic backgrounds. Based on such data,\nthe following correction factors, based on data from the UK, could\nbe applied when assessing CVD risk using risk calculators.105 Ideally,\ncountry and risk-calculator-specific RRs should be used, as the impact\nof ethnicity may vary between regions and risk calculators.\n• Southern Asian: multiply the risk by 1.3 for Indians and\nBangladeshis, and 1.7 for Pakistanis.\n• Other Asian: multiply the risk by 1.1.\n• Black Caribbean: multiply the risk by 0.85.\n• Black African and Chinese: multiply the risk by 0.7.\nBox 2. Core topics for psychosocial assessment\nSimultaneous diagnostic assessment\nAt least one in five patients carries a diagnosis of a mental disorder, usually presenting with bodily\nsymptoms (e.g. chest tightness, shortness of breath). Therefore, physicians should be equally atten-\ntive to somatic as to emotional causes of symptoms.\nScreening\nScreening instruments assessing depression, anxiety, and insomnia are recommended (e.g. Patient\nHealth Questionnaire,116 see Supplementary Table 5).117,118\nStressors\nThere are simple questions to get into a conversation about significant stressors112: Are you both-\nered by stress at work, financial problems, difficulties in the family, loneliness, or any stressful events?\nNeed for mental health support\nAre you interested in a referral to a psychotherapist or mental health service?\n3258\nESC Guidelines\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/34/3227/6358713 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n.............................................................................................................................................................................\n3.3.3. Imaging\n3.3.3.1 Coronary artery calcium\nCoronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring can reclassify CVD risk\nupwards and downwards in addition to conventional risk factors,\nand may thus be considered in men and women with calculated\nrisks around decision thresholds.103,104 Availability and cost-\neffectiveness of large-scale CAC scanning must, however, be con-\nsidered in a locoregional context (see section 2.3 on cost-\neffectiveness). If CAC is detected, its extent should be compared\nwith what would be expected for a patient of the same sex and\nage. Higher-than-expected CAC increases the person’s calculated\nrisk, whereas absent or lower-than-expected CAC is associated\nwith lower than calculated risk. CAC scoring does not provide\ndirect information on total plaque burden or stenosis severity,\nand can be low or even zero in middle-aged patients with soft\nnon-calcified plaque. Clinicians are advised to consult existing pro-\ntocols for details of how to assess and interpret CAC scores.\n3.3.3.2 Contrast computed tomography coronary angiography\nContrast computed tomography angiography (CCTA) allows\nidentification\nof\ncoronary\nstenoses\nand\npredicts\ncardiac\nevents.119\nIn\nthe\nSCOT-HEART\n(Scottish\nComputed\nTomography of the Heart) study, 5-year rates of coronary death\nor myocardial infarction were reduced when CCTA was used in\npatients with stable chest pain.120 The relative reduction in myo-\ncardial infarction was similar in patients with non-cardiac chest\npain. Whether CCTA improves risk classification or adds prog-\nnostic value over CAC scoring is unknown.\n3.3.3.3 Carotid ultrasound\nSystematic use of intima-media thickness (IMT) to improve risk\nassessment is not recommended due to the lack of methodological\nstandardization, and the absence of added value of IMT in predicting\nfuture CVD events, even in the intermediate-risk group.121\nPlaque is defined as the presence of a focal wall thickening that is\n>_50% greater than the surrounding vessel wall, or as a focal region\nwith an IMT measurement >_1.5 mm that protrudes into the\nlumen.122 Although the evidence is less extensive than it is for CAC,\ncarotid artery plaque assessment using ultrasonography probably\nalso reclassifies CVD risk,104,122 and may be considered as a risk\nmodifier in patients at intermediate risk when a CAC score is not\nfeasible.\n3.3.3.4 Arterial stiffness\nArterial stiffness is commonly measured using either aortic pulse\nwave velocity or arterial augmentation index. Studies suggest that\narterial stiffness predicts future CVD risk and improves risk classifica-\ntion.123 However, measurement difficulties and substantial publica-\ntion bias106 argue against widespread use.\n3.3.3.5 Ankle brachial index\nEstimates are that 12\u000227% of middle-aged individuals have an\nankle brachial index (ABI) <0.9, around 50\u000289% of whom do not\nhave typical claudication.124 An individual patient data meta-\nanalysis concluded that the reclassification potential of ABI was\nlimited, perhaps with the exception of women at intermediate\nrisk.125\n3.3.3.6 Echocardiography\nIn view of the lack of convincing evidence that it improves CVD risk\nreclassification, echocardiography is not recommended to improve\nCV risk prediction.\n3.3.4.Frailty\nFrailty is a multidimensional state, independent of age and multimor-\nbidity, that makes the individual more vulnerable to the effect of\nstressors. It constitutes a functional risk factor for unfavourable out-\ncomes, including both high CV and non-CV morbidity and\nmortality.126,127\nFrailty is not the same as ageing and the two should not be con-\nfused. The incidence of frailty increases with age, but people of the\nsame chronological age can differ significantly in terms of health status\nand vitality. ‘Biological age’ is much more important in the context of\nclinical status (including frailty features) and hard clinical outcomes\n(including CVD events).126,127 Similarly, although the presence of\ncomorbidities can exacerbate frailty within an individual, frailty is not\nthe same as multimorbidity (see section 6.7).\nFrailty screening is indicated in every elderly patient, but should also\nbe performed in every individual regardless of his/her age, when being\nat risk of accelerated ageing.126,127 Most of the tools relate to frail fea-\ntures, including slowness, weakness, low physical activity (PA), exhaus-\ntion, and shrinking (e.g. Fried scale, Short Physical Performance\nBattery, Rockwood Clinical Frailty Scale, handgrip strength, gait\nspeed).126\u0002129 Frailty assessment is important at each stage of an\nASCVD trajectory. During an acute CVD event, however, frailty\nassessment is more difficult, and either relies on history taking or\nshould be postponed to when patients return to a stable condition.\nFrailty is a potential modifier of global CVD risk. The impact of frailty\non CVD risk has been demonstrated across the spectrum of ASCVD,\nincluding people with ASCVD risk factors, patients with subclinical\nASCVD, stable ASCVD, acute cerebral and coronary syndromes, and\nHF,126\u0002130 with frailty itself rather than classical CVD risk factors pre-\ndicting both all-cause and CVD mortality in the very old.130,131\nImportantly, the ability of frailty measures to improve CVD risk predic-\ntion has not been formally assessed. Hence, we do not recommend\nthat frailty measures are integrated into formal CVD risk assessment.\nImportantly, frailty may influence treatment. Non-pharmacological\ninterventions (e.g. balanced nutrition, micronutrient supplementa-\ntion, exercise training, social activation) aiming to prevent, attenuate,\nor reverse frailty are of utmost importance.126,127,132 In terms of\npharmacotherapy and device implantations, frailty assessment is not a\nmethod to determine the eligibility for any particular treatment, but\nrather serves to build an individualized care plan with predefined pri-\norities. Frail individuals often have comorbidities, polypharmacy, and\nmay be more susceptible to drug side-effects and serious complica-\ntions during invasive and surgical procedures.126,127\n3.3.5. Family history\nFamily history of premature CVD is a simple indicator of CVD risk,\nreflecting the genetic and environment interplay.133 In the few studies\nthat simultaneously assessed the effects of family history and genetics,\nfamily history remained significantly associated with CVD after adjust-\ning for genetic scores.134,135 However, family history only marginally\nimproves the prediction of CVD risk beyond conventional ASCVD\nrisk factors.136\u0002141 Possible explanations are the varying definitions\nESC Guidelines\n3259\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/34/3227/6358713 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n.....................................\nof family history applied and that conventional ASCVD risk factors\nlargely explain the impact of family history.\nA family history of premature CVD is simple, inexpensive informa-\ntion that can trigger comprehensive risk assessment in individuals\nwith a family history of premature CVD.136\n3.3.6. Genetics\nThe aetiology of ASCVD has a genetic component, but this informa-\ntion is not currently used in preventive approaches.142 Advances on\npolygenic risk scores for risk stratification could increase the use of\ngenetics in prevention.143\u0002145 For ASCVD, there is, however, a lack\nof consensus regarding which genes and corresponding single nucleo-\ntide polymorphisms should be included, and whether to use risk\nfactor-specific\nor\noutcome-specific\npolygenic\nrisk\nscores.146\nPolygenic risk scoring has shown some potential to improve ASCVD\nrisk prediction for primary prevention,147\u0002149 but the incremental\nprediction accuracy is relatively modest and needs further evaluation\nin both men and women.150,151 Additional evidence is also needed to\nevaluate the clinical utility of polygenic risk scores in other clinical set-\ntings, such as in patients with pre-existing ASCVD.152\n3.3.7. Socioeconomic determinants\nLow socioeconomic status and work stress are independently associ-\nated with ASCVD development and prognosis in both sexes.153,154\nThe strongest association has been found between low income and\nCVD mortality, with a RR of 1.76 [95% confidence interval (CI)\n1.45\u00022.14].155 Work stress is determined by job strain (i.e. the com-\nbination of high demands and low control at work) and effort-reward\nimbalance. There is preliminary evidence that the detrimental impact\nof work stress on ASCVD health is independent of conventional risk\nfactors and their treatment.156\n3.3.8. Environmental exposure\nEnvironmental exposures with CVD risk modifying potential include\nair and soil pollution as well as above-threshold noise levels.\nEvaluating individual cumulative exposure to pollutants and noise\nremains challenging, but when available, might impact on individual\nrisk assessment.\nComponents of outdoor air pollution include airborne particulate\nmatter [PM; ranging in size from coarse particles 2.5\u000210 mm in diam-\neter, to fine (<2.5 mm; PM2.5), and ultrafine (<0.1 mm)] and gaseous\npollutants (e.g. ozone, nitrogen dioxide, volatile organic compounds,\ncarbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide), produced primarily by combus-\ntion of fossil fuels. Soil and water pollutions are also CVD risk modi-\nfiers; increased exposure to lead, arsenic, and cadmium is associated\nwith multiple CVD outcomes including hypertension, coronary heart\ndisease (CHD), stroke, and CVD mortality.157 Ambient PM pollution\nrecently ranked as a leading modifiable mortality risk factor and also\nresponsible for attributable disability adjusted life-years at the global\nlevel.158 A recent model estimated that loss of life expectancy due to\nambient air pollution is similar to, if not exceeding, that due to\ntobacco smoking, and accounts for a global excess mortality esti-\nmated at 8.8 million/year.159\nThe short-term attributable effects on mortality are linked primar-\nily to exposure to PM, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone, with an average\n1.0% increase of all-cause mortality for an increment of 10 lg/m3 in\nexposure to PM2.5; the long-term effects are associated mainly with\nPM2.5.

Body fat stored in\nvisceral and other ectopic depots carries a higher risk than subcuta-\nneous fat. Several measures of global and abdominal fat are available,\nof which waist circumference is the simplest to measure.

The main risk-related sequa-\nlae of adiposity include hypertension, dyslipidaemia, insulin resistance,\nsystemic inflammation, a prothrombotic state, albuminuria, as well as a\ndecline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)171 and the devel-\nopment of type 2 DM, CVD events, as well as HF and AF.\n3.4. Clinical conditions\nIndividual calculated risks of CVD, as evaluated by conventional risk\nfactors in risk scores, are subject to refinement by potential risk\nmodifiers as highlighted in section 3.3. Beyond these potential modi-\nfiers, specific clinical conditions can influence CVD risk. These clinical\nconditions often increase the likelihood of CVD, or are associated\nwith poorer clinical prognosis. The current section reviews some of\nthese conditions, which are not often included in traditional risk\nscores but may be integrated in some national risk scores. Here we\ndiscuss how these conditions increase this risk.\nMany clinical conditions share common CVD and ASCVD risk fac-\ntors and therefore treating these allows a synergistic reduction in the\noverall burden of disease.\n3.4.1. Chronic kidney disease\nWorldwide, the total number of individuals with chronic kidney dis-\nease (CKD) who are not treated with kidney replacement therapy\nwas approximately 850 million in 2017.194 This number accounts to a\nprevalence of 10 - 12% among men and women. CKD is the third\nfastest growing cause of death globally.195\nCKD is defined as abnormalities of kidney structure or function,\npresent for >3 months, with health implications. Criteria and markers\nof kidney damage, especially kidney disease due to DM, are albuminu-\nria [albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) >30 mg/g in spot urine speci-\nmens] and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) <60 mL/min/1.73 m2.\nGFR can be estimated (eGFR) from calibrated serum creatinine and\nestimating equations using the CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease\nEpidemiology) Collaboration formula. Kidney disease severity is dif-\nferentiated into stages (categories) according to the level of GFR and\nalbuminuria; a patient with an eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 is classified\nas having CKD stage 3a, which represents an advanced kidney func-\ntion impairment.172\nAmong persons with CKD, CVD is the leading cause of morbidity\nand death.196 Even after adjustment for known CAD risk factors, includ-\ning DM and hypertension, mortality risk progressively increases with\nworsening CKD.197 As GFR declines below approximately 60- 75 mL/\nmin/1.73 m2, the probability of developing CAD increases linearly,198\nwith up to triple the CVD mortality risk when reaching an eGFR of 15\nmL/min/1.73 m2. Kidney disease is associated with a very high CVD risk.\nAmong persons with CKD, there is a high prevalence of traditional\nCAD risk factors, such as DM and hypertension. The use of CAC score\nto risk stratify patients with CKD might be a promising tool.199\u0002203\nFurthermore, persons with CKD are also exposed to other non-\ntraditional ASCVD risk factors such as uraemia-related ones, including\ninflammation, oxidative stress, and promotors of vascular calcification.\nCKD and kidney failure not only increase the risk of CAD, they also\nmodify its clinical presentation and cardinal symptoms.204\n3.4.2. Atrial fibrillation\nAtrial fibrillation (AF) appears to be associated with an increased risk\nof death and of CVD and kidney disease.205 Furthermore, AF appears\nto be a stronger risk factor for CVD in women than in men.206\nThe prevalence of AF ranges between 2% and 4%, and a 2.3-fold\nrise is expected, owing in part to ageing of the population and intensi-\nfied searching for undiagnosed AF, as well as lower CV death.207 The\nage-adjusted incidence, prevalence, and lifetime risk of AF are lower\nin women vs. men and in non-white vs. white cohorts.208,209 The life-\ntime AF risk estimate is now 1 in 3 individuals of European ancestry\nat an index age of 55 years.210 ASCVD risk factor burden and comor-\nbidities, including lifestyle factors, and age significantly affect the life-\ntime risk for AF development.211\u0002213 The observed effect of clinical\nASCVD risk factor burden and multiple comorbidities on the lifetime\nrisk of AF (significantly increasing from 23.4% among individuals with\nan optimal clinical risk factor profile to 33.4% and 38.4% in those with\nborderline and elevated clinical risk factors, respectively214) suggests\nthat early intervention and control of modifiable ASCVD risk factors\ncould reduce incident AF. The continuum of unhealthy lifestyle, risk\nfactor(s), and CVDs can contribute to atrial remodelling/cardiomy-\nopathy and development of AF that commonly results from a com-\nbined effect of multiple interacting factors (Figure 9).215 Risk factor\nand CVD management reduces AF burden. Targeted therapy of\nunderlying conditions may significantly improve maintenance of sinus\nrhythm in patients with persistent AF and HF.216 However, studies\naddressing isolated management of specific conditions alone (e.g.\nhypertension) yielded inconsistent findings.217\nThe overall annual risk of ischaemic stroke in patients with AF is\n5%,\nbut\nvaries\nconsiderably\naccording\nto\ncomorbidities.215\nCardioembolic strokes associated with AF are usually more severe,\nand often recurrent.218 Furthermore, AF appears to be a stronger\npredictor of stroke in women than in men.215 AF is also associated\nwith impaired cognitive function, ranging from mild cognitive impair-\nment to dementia.219 AF is independently associated with a two-fold\nincreased risk of all-cause mortality in women and a 1.5-fold\nincreased risk in men.220 In one population, the most common causes\nof death were HF (14.5%), malignancy (23.1%), and infection/sepsis\n(17.3%), while stroke-related mortality was only 6.5%.221 These data\nindicate that, in addition to anticoagulation and HF treatment, comor-\nbid conditions need to be actively treated to reduce AF-related mor-\ntality and morbidity.\nRegarding PA, both sedentary lifestyles and very high levels of PA\nare associated with development of AF (U-shaped association),\nthrough different mechanisms. Furthermore, when AF develops in\nathletes it is not associated with the same increased risk of stroke.\n3.4.3. Heart failure\nHeart failure (HF) of ischaemic origin constitutes a severe clinical\nmanifestation of ASCVD. Conversely, HF itself (predominantly of\nischaemic aetiology) increases the risk of CVD events (myocardial\ninfarction, arrhythmias, ischaemic stroke, CV death).\nAsymptomatic LV dysfunction (systolic or/and diastolic dysfunc-\ntion) as well as overt symptomatic HF [across the spectrum of LVEF,\ni.e. HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), HF with mid-range\nejection fraction,222 and HF with preserved ejection fraction\n(HFpEF)] increases the risk of urgent CV hospitalizations (including\nhospitalizations due to HF worsening) and CV and all-cause deaths.\n3262\nESC Guidelines\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/34/3227/6358713 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n.............................................\nThese unfavourable effects on clinical outcomes have been demon-\nstrated in asymptomatic subjects without overt CVD, in patients with\nacute and previous myocardial infarction, in patients with acute and\nprevious stroke, and in patients with other clinical manifestations of\nCVD.223\nThe diagnosis of ischaemic HF positions individuals at very high CV\nrisk, and justifies recommendations as for secondary prevention ther-\napeutic strategies. Additionally, for patients with symptomatic HFrEF,\nseveral drugs are recommended to reduce the risk of CV morbidity\nand mortality (see section 6.2).\n3.4.4. Cancer\nIn patients with cancer, there is an overlap between cancer and\nASCVD risk factors, with shared biological mechanisms and genetic\npredispositions. Prevention and treatment of these is therefore\nbeneficial in reducing both CVD as well as cancer risk. Moreover, the\nrates of the extent of CVD risk depend on both the CVD toxicity of\ntreatments and patient-related factors. Owing to recent improve-\nments in clinical outcomes for many patients with cancer, CVD mor-\ntality may ultimately exceed those from most forms of cancer\nrecurrence.224,225\nThe rapidly expanding variety of novel anticancer drugs/adjuvant\ntherapies has demonstrated a wide range of both early and late CVD\nside-effects, including cardiomyopathy, LV dysfunction, HF, hyperten-\nsion, CAD, arrhythmias, and other injuries. Therefore, effective strat-\negies for the prediction and prevention of CVD toxicities are\ncritically important. The latency and severity of radiotherapy cardio-\ntoxicity, as well as accelerated atherosclerosis and cerebral vascular\ndisease, is related to multiple factors, including the dose (total per\nfraction),\nthe\nvolume\nof\nthe\nheart\nirradiated,\nconcomitant\nRisk factors for AF\nHypertension\nObesity\nDiabetes mellitus\nPhysical activity\nOSA\nAlcohol\nDyslipidemia\nSmoking\nLifestyle modification\nAF risk factors modification\nTreatment of underlying CV conditions\nReduction of mortality and\nmorbidity\nPrimary prevention of AF\nReduction of mortality and\nmorbidity\nSymptomatic improvement\nSecondary prevention of AF\nModifiable\nAgeing\nGenetics\nHeart failure\nCAD\nValvular heart\ndisease\nCOPD\nLifestyle modification\nAF risk factors modification\nTreatment of underlying CV conditions\nStroke prevention\nRate control\nAAD therapy\nCardioversion\nCatheter ablation\nSurgery\nNon- or partly modifiable\nLA remodeling\nElectrical\nBiochemical\nInflammation\nReversible\nFibrosis\nScarring\nDilatation\nNon-reversible\nAF outcomes\nMortality\nStroke/systemic thromboembolism\nSymptoms and quality of life\nHeart failure\nDementia\nMyocardial infarction\nHospitalizations and healthcare costs\nAF development and progression\nParoxysmal\nPersistent\nPermanent\nFigure 9 The role of risk factors and comorbidities in atrial fibrillation.215 AF = atrial fibrillation; CAD = coronary artery disease; COPD = chronic\nobstructive pulmonary disease; CV = cardiovascular; DM = diabetes mellitus; HF = heart failure; OSA = obstructive sleep apnoea.\nESC Guidelines\n3263\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/34/3227/6358713 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n.............................................................................................................................................................................\nadministration of other cardiotoxic drugs, and patient factors (which\ninclude, amongst other factors, younger age, traditional risk factors,\nand history of heart disease).226,227 Furthermore, radio- and chemo-\ntherapy\nmay\nexert\ndirect\nvascular\neffects\nand\nincrease\natherosclerosis-related CVD outcomes.227,228\n3.4.4.1 Diagnosis and screening\nSigns or symptoms of cardiac dysfunction should be monitored\nbefore and periodically during and after cancer treatment for early\ndetection of abnormalities in patients receiving potentially cardio-\ntoxic chemotherapy. Detection of subclinical abnormalities using\nimaging and measurement of circulating biomarkers (such as cardiac\ntroponins and natriuretic peptides) is currently recommended.173,229\nMeasures of myocardial strain, particularly systolic global longitudinal\nstrain, may precede a significant decline in LVEF.230\u0002233\n3.4.4.2 Prevention of cardiotoxicity and cardiovascular risk factors\nRCTs of preventive therapy with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone sys-\ntem (RAAS) inhibitors and/or beta-blockers after trastuzumab or\nanthracyclines have reported contradictory results.230,234,235 The\nmain benefits are less marked LV remodelling or a reduced decline in\nLVEF observed with cardiac magnetic resonance, but translation into\nbetter outcomes remains speculative.\nExercise should be strongly advised. In particular, aerobic exercise is\nconsidered a promising non-pharmacological strategy to prevent and/\nor treat chemotherapy toxicity.236 A study showed a significantly\nhigher risk of CVD in survivors of childhood cancer than in non-cancer\nadult controls, and particularly in survivors of adult-onset cancer with\nunderlying ASCVD risk factors.237 Therefore, aggressive management\nof ASCVD risk factors in this population is recommended.\n3.4.5. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a complex, pro-\ngressive respiratory disorder and currently the fourth leading cause\nof death worldwide. It is characterized by chronic airflow limitation\nwith respiratory symptoms and is associated with an increased\ninflammatory response and abnormalities of the airways caused by\nsignificant exposure to noxious particles or gases (mainly smoking).\nAlthough COPD is recognized and thoroughly investigated as a CVD\ncomorbidity, its role as an ASCVD risk factor is not well established.\nNevertheless, COPD patients have a two- to three- fold increased\nrisk of CVD compared with age-matched controls when adjusted for\ntobacco smoking. Patients with mild-to-moderate COPD are 8\u000210\ntimes more likely to die from ASCVD than respiratory failure, having\nhigher rates of hospitalization and death due to CVD, stroke, and\nHF.238,239 CVD also runs undiagnosed; less than one-third of COPD\npatients with electrocardiographic (ECG) evidence of myocardial\ninfarction are diagnosed with CVD.240 CVD mortality increases by\n28%, and the frequency of non-fatal coronary events by 20%, for\nevery 10% decrease in the forced expiratory volume in 1 second\n(FEV1).241 Acute COPD exacerbations, mainly due to infections, are\nfrequent and are responsible for a four-fold increase of CVD\nevents.242 The risk of both myocardial infarction and ischaemic stroke\nis increased during the 3 months after an acute exacerbation.243\nThe high prevalence of CVD in COPD patients may be explained\nby the fact that both diseases share common risk factors, such as\nsmoking, ageing, hypertension, and dyslipidaemia.244 Metabolic\nsyndrome and reduced PA is present in 34% of COPD patients, with\nits most prevalent components being hypertension (56%), abdominal\nobesity (39%), and hyperglycaemia (44%).245 CVD may be caused by\nhypoxia during exercise due to lung hyperinflation, high resting heart\nrates, impaired vasodilatory capacity, and peripheral, cardiac, and\nneurohumoral sympathetic stress. Atherosclerosis and coronary\nartery calcification may be the result of oxidative stress, and reduc-\ntions in antiaging molecules causing both lung and vascular ageing.246\nSystemic inflammation is prominent in COPD, with circulating bio-\nmarkers in high concentrations and associated with increased mortal-\nity.247 Troponin is elevated during an acute exacerbation of COPD,\nand 10% of hospitalized patients meet the definition of acute myocar-\ndial infarction (AMI).248 B-natriuretic peptide level, if elevated,\nincreases the mortality risk.249\nSystemic inflammation and oxidative stress caused by COPD pro-\nmote vascular remodelling, stiffness, and atherosclerosis, and induce\na ‘procoagulant’ state that affects all vasculature types.250 Cognitive\nimpairment and dementia due to cerebral microvascular damage is\ncorrelated with COPD severity; patients have a 20% increased risk\nfor both ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke, which may be up to\nseven-fold higher following an acute exacerbation.251 PAD is present\nin about 9% of COPD patients,252 who have an almost doubled risk\nof developing PAD,253 as well as an increased prevalence of carotid\nplaques related to the disease severity.254 Finally, COPD is positively\nassociated with abdominal aortic aneurysm, regardless of smoking\nstatus.255\nCardiac arrhythmias are common and may be due to the haemo-\ndynamic effects (pulmonary hypertension, diastolic dysfunction, atrial\nstructural, and electrical remodelling) caused by the disease in combi-\nnation with autonomic imbalance and abnormal ventricular repolari-\nzation.256 AF is frequent, directly associated with FEV1, usually\ntriggered by acute exacerbations of COPD, and an independent pre-\ndictor of in-hospital COPD mortality.257,258 COPD is also a risk fac-\ntor for ventricular tachycardia independent of LVEF,259 and for\nsudden cardiac death independent of CVD risk profile.260\nUnrecognized ventricular dysfunction is common in COPD,261\nalthough HF is 3.8 times more common in COPD patients than in\ncontrols.262 Patients with frequent acute exacerbations have a high\nfrequency of diastolic dysfunction; HFpEF risk is higher because of a\nhigh prevalence of hypertension and DM.263\nConsidering these facts, it seems of upmost importance to screen\nCOPD patients for ASCVD and ASCVD risk factors, bearing in mind\nthat COPD affects the accuracy of CVD diagnostic tests. Achieving\nadequate exercise is difficult, vasodilators for myocardial perfusion\nscanning may be contraindicated because of the risk of broncho-\nspasm, and stress or transthoracic echocardiography is often dis-\nturbed by poor ultrasound windows. Computed tomography\ncoronary angiography or magnetic resonance imaging may be alterna-\ntives, but remain expensive, time consuming, and not always\navailable.\nThe use of COPD medications (i.e. long-acting muscarinic antago-\nnists and long-acting beta agonists) is not associated with overall CV\nadverse events in patients with stable COPD. Olodaterol may reduce\nthe risk of overall CV adverse events and formoterol may decrease\nthe risk of cardiac ischaemia. Long-acting beta agonists may reduce\nthe incidence of hypertension, but may also increase the risk of HF,\nso should be used with caution in HF patients.264\n3264\nESC Guidelines\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/34/3227/6358713 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n.............................................................................................................................................................................\n3.4.6. Inflammatory conditions\nInflammatory conditions increase CVD risk both acutely and over\ntime. The best evidence for chronic inflammation increasing CVD\nrisk is available for rheumatoid arthritis, which increases CVD risk by\napproximately 50% beyond established risk factors.176 Hence, a low\nthreshold for assessment of total CVD risk is appropriate in adults\nwith rheumatoid arthritis, and one should consider increasing the risk\nestimate based on the level of disease activity.176 There is also evi-\ndence for an approximately 20% increased CVD risk in patients with\nactive inflammatory bowel disease.265\nIn other chronic inflammatory conditions, such as psoriasis177 and\nankylosing spondylitis,178 CVD risk may also be increased. However,\nthe strength of the evidence is less strong, as is the independence of\nsuch increased risks from the classical ASCVD risk factors.\nNonetheless, it seems prudent to at least consider CVD risk assess-\nment in patients with any chronic inflammatory condition, and to\ntake into account the presence of such conditions when there is\ndoubt regarding initiation of preventive interventions. The cumulative\ndisease burden and recent degree of inflammation are important\ndeterminants of the risk-enhancing effect.\nApart from optimal anti-inflammatory treatment, CVD risk in\ninflammatory conditions should be treated with similar interventions\nas in the general high-risk population, as there is evidence that tradi-\ntional methods to lessen risk (e.g. lipid-lowering treatment) are just\nas beneficial in preventing ASCVD.\n3.4.7. Infections (human immunodeficiency virus,\ninfluenza, periodontitis)\nInfection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is associated\nwith a 19% increased risk of LEAD and CAD beyond that explained\nby traditional atherosclerotic risk factors.266,267 However, for those\nwith sustained CD4 cell counts <200 cells/mm3, the risk of incident\nLEAD events is nearly two-fold higher, whereas for those with sus-\ntained CD4 cell counts >_500 cells/mm3, there is no excess risk of\nincident LEAD events compared with uninfected people.268\nCVD and influenza have long been associated, due to an overlap in\nthe peak incidence of each disease during winter months.\nEpidemiological studies have noted an increase in CV deaths during\ninfluenza epidemics, indicating that CV complications of influenza\ninfection, including acute ischaemic heart disease and, less often,\nstroke, are important contributors to morbidity and mortality during\ninfluenza infection.\nThe risk of AMI or stroke is more than four times higher after a\nrespiratory tract infection, with the highest risk in the first 3 days after\ndiagnosis.269 Preventing influenza, particularly by means of vaccina-\ntion, could prevent influenza-triggered AMI.270\nStudies have linked periodontal disease to both atherosclerosis and\nCVD,271\u0002273 and serological studies have linked elevated antibody titres\nof periodontal bacteria to atherosclerotic disease.274 Nevertheless, if\nactive treatment or prevention of periodontitis improves, clinical prog-\nnosis requires further studies despite preliminary evidence.275\u0002277\n3.4.8. Migraine\nMigraine is a highly prevalent condition affecting around 15% of the\ngeneral population.278 There are two main types of migraine—\nmigraine without aura, which is the most common subtype, and\nmigraine with aura, which accounts for about one-third of all\nmigraines; in many patients the two forms coexist.\nAvailable data indicate that migraine overall is associated with a\ntwo-fold increased risk of ischaemic stroke and a 1.5-fold increase in\nthe risk of cardiac ischaemic disease.179\u0002181,279,280 The associations\nare more evident for migraine with aura.179,180,280 Given the young\nmean age of the population affected by migraine, the absolute\nincrease in risk is small at the individual level, but high at the popula-\ntion level because of the high migraine prevalence.281\nSeveral lines of evidence also indicate that the vascular risk of sub-\njects with migraine may be magnified by cigarette smoking182 and by the\nuse of combined hormonal contraceptives.183,281\u0002283 Contraception\nusing combined hormonal contraceptives should therefore be avoided\nin women with migraine.282,283 However, further information is needed\nas good-quality studies assessing risk of stroke associated with low-\ndose oestrogen use in women with migraine are lacking.\n3.4.9.Sleep disorders and obstructive sleep apnoea\nSleep disturbances or abnormal sleep durations are associated with\nincreased CVD risk.284\u0002286 Regarding sleep duration, 7 h seems to\nbe optimal for CV health.287\nIn the general population, the prevalence of general sleep distur-\nbances is around 32.1%: 8.2% for insomnia, 6.1% for parasomnia,\n5.9% for hypersomnolence, 12.5% for restless legs disorder and limb\nmovements during sleep, and 7.1% for sleep-related breathing disor-\nder [e.g. obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA)].288 All sleep disturbances\nare strongly associated with mental disorders and share hyperarousal\nas an underlying mechanism.289,290\nThe most important sleep-related breathing disorder is OSA,\nwhich is characterized by repetitive episodes of apnoea, each exceed-\ning 10 seconds. Despite the strong associations of OSA with CVD,\nincluding hypertension, stroke, HF, CAD, and AF, treatment of OSA\nby positive airway pressure (PAP) has failed to improve hard CV out-\ncomes in patients with established CVD.291\u0002293 Therefore, interven-\ntions that include behaviour change (reduction of obesity, alcohol\nabstinence), sleep hygiene, and stress reduction in addition to PAP are\nneeded.290,294 Regarding hypertension and OSA, there are modest\neffects of PAP on BP levels, but only in patients with ABPM-confirmed\nresistant hypertension who use PAP for more than 5.8 h/night.295\n3.4.10. Mental disorders\nThe 12-month prevalence of mental disorders or mental health dis-\norders in the general European population is between 27% and 38%\ndepending on sources and definitions.296 All mental disorders (e.g.\nanxiety disorders, somatoform disorders, substance disorders, per-\nsonality disorders, mood disorders, and psychotic disorders) are\nassociated with the development of CVD and reduced life expect-\nancy in both sexes.297\u0002300 The risk increases with the severity of the\nmental disturbance and vigilance for (often non-specific) symptoms is\ncrucial.301 The onset of CVD is associated with an approximately\n2\u00023-fold increased risk of mental disorders compared to a healthy\npopulation.115,302 In this context, screening should be performed at\nevery consultation (or 2\u00024 times/year). The 12-month prevalence of\nmental disorders in CVD patients is around 40%, leading to signifi-\ncantly worse prognosis.100,108,303,304 The onset of CVD increases the\nrisk of committing suicide.305 In this context, awareness of anxiety\nand depression symptoms should be increased.\nESC Guidelines\n3265\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/34/3227/6358713 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n.............................................................................................................................................................................\nThe precise mechanism by which mental disorders increase CVD\nremains uncertain. The detrimental effects are potentially caused by\nunhealthy lifestyle, increased exposure to socioeconomic stressors,\nand cardiometabolic side-effects of some medications,113 but also by\ndirect effects of the amygdala-based fear-defence system and other\ndirect pathophysiological pathways.303 Abuse of psychostimulants\n(e.g. cocaine) is a powerful trigger of myocardial ischaemia.306\nFurther, the capacity of these patients to adaptively use the health-\ncare systems is impaired due to their mental condition (e.g. not being\nable to trust other people and seek help, impaired capacity to be\nadherent).100 Barriers on the part of healthcare providers are stigma-\ntizing attitudes, insufficient mental health literacy, and lack of confi-\ndence in mental healthcare.307\u0002309 Although patients with mental\ndisorders have an increased CVD risk, they receive a lower rate of\nrecognition and treatment of traditional ASCVD risk factors.310\nPreliminary evidence suggests that taking mental disorders into\naccount improves classical CVD risk models.311,312\nCertain categories of patients with learning difficulties and associ-\nated disorders (such as Down’s syndrome) are at increased risk of\nCVD disease, but perhaps not specifically ASCVD. However, health\ninequalities and the prevalence of CV risk factors may be greater in\nthese populations, although epidemiology research is scarce.\n3.4.11. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease\nNon-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been associated with\nan increased risk of myocardial infarction and stroke. NAFLD repre-\nsents accumulation of ectopic fat; persons with NAFLD are often\noverweight or obese, and not uncommonly have abnormal BP, glu-\ncose, and lipid levels. A recent study investigating whether NAFLD\nincreases CV risk beyond traditional risk factors313 shows that after\nadjusting for established risk factors, the associations did not persist.\nNevertheless, patients with NAFLD should have their CVD risk cal-\nculated, be screened for DM, and be recommended a healthy lifestyle\nwith a reduction of alcohol intake.\n3.4.12. Sex-specific conditions\n3.4.12.1 Obstetric conditions\nPre-eclampsia (defined as pregnancy-related hypertension accompa-\nnied by proteinuria) occurs in 1\u00022% of all pregnancies and is associated\nwith an increase in CVD risk by a factor of 1.5\u00022.7 compared with all\nwomen,185,186,314 while the RR of developing hypertension is 3187 and\nDM is 2.184,185 It has not been established whether the increased CVD\nrisk after preeclampsia occurs independently of CV risk factors. The\nrationale for screening these women for the occurrence of hyperten-\nsion and DM is, however, quite strong. At present, no separate risk\nmodel for women with a history of hypertensive disorders of preg-\nnancy seems necessary, despite their higher baseline risk.315\nPregnancy-related hypertension affects 10\u000215% of all pregnancies.\nThe associated risk of later CVD is lower than for preeclampsia but is\nstill elevated (RR 1.7\u00022.5).193,314,316,317 Also, the risk for sustained or\nfuture hypertension is elevated (RRs vary, from 2.0 to 7.2 or even\nhigher).187,318 Again, however, there was incomplete adjustment for\nconventional risk factors. The risk of developing DM is also elevated\nin these women (RR 1.6\u00022.0).314,319 Both preterm (RR 1.6) and still-\nbirth (RR 1.5) have been associated with a moderate increase in risk\nof CVD.316\nFinally, gestational DM confers a sharply elevated risk of future\nDM, with up to 50% of affected women developing DM within 5\nyears after pregnancy, and an up to two-fold increased risk of CVD in\nthe future.188,320 Screening by fasting glucose or HbA1c may be pref-\nerable to oral glucose tolerance testing.191,321\n3.4.12.2 Non-obstetric conditions\nPolycystic ovary syndrome affects 5% of all women in their fertile\nyears.322,323 It has been associated with an increased risk of CVD.314\nThe risk of developing hypertension is probably increased, but data\nare conflicting.324 Polycystic ovary syndrome is associated with a\nhigher risk of developing DM (RR 2\u00024),189,190 suggesting that peri-\nodic screening for DM is appropriate.\nPremature menopause occurs in roughly 1% of women <_40 years\nof age. Up to 10% of women experience an early menopause, defined\nas that occurring by 45 years of age.314,325 Early menopause is associ-\nated with an increased risk of CVD (RR 1.5).326\u0002328 A linear inverse\nrelationship between earlier menopause and CHD risk has been\nfound, whereby each 1-year decrease in age at menopause por-\ntended a 2% increased risk of CHD.329\n3.4.12.3 Erectile dysfunction\nErectile dysfunction (ED), defined as the consistent inability to reach\nand maintain an erection satisfactory for sexual activity, has a multi-\nfactorial cause. It affects almost 40% and more than 50% of men over\n40 years and 60 years of age, respectively.330,331 Men with ED have\nan increased risk of all-cause mortality [odds ratio (OR) 1.26, 95% CI\n1.01\u00021.57] and CVD mortality (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.00\u00022.05). ED\nand CVD share common risk factors (hypercholesterolaemia, hyper-\ntension, insulin resistance and DM, smoking, obesity, metabolic syn-\ndrome, sedentary\nlifestyle,\nand\ndepression) and\na common\npathophysiological basis of aetiology and progression.332,333\nMedication used to prevent CVD, such as aldosterone receptor\nantagonists, some beta-blockers, and thiazide diuretics, can cause\nED.330,332\u0002335 ED is associated with subclinical vascular disease,336 and\nprecedes CAD, stroke, and PAD by a period that usually ranges from 2\nto 5 years (average 3 years). Men with ED have a 44\u000259% higher risk\nfor total CV events, 62% for AMI, 39% for stroke, and 24\u000233% for all-\ncause mortality, with a higher risk in those with severe ED.337\u0002341\nThere is strong evidence that CVD risk assessment is needed in men\npresenting with ED.336,342 In men with ED and low-to-intermediate\nCVD risk, detailed risk profiling by, for example, CAC score is sug-\ngested, but so far not supported by evidence.338,341 Assessment of ED\nseverity and physical examination should be part of the first-line CVD\nrisk assessment in men.333,341 Lifestyle changes are effective in improving\nsexual function in men: these include vigorous physical exercise,334,343\nimproved nutrition, weight control, and smoking cessation.343\u0002345\n4. Risk factors and interventions\nat the individual level\n4.1. Treatment recommendations:\nclasses, grades, and freedom of choice\nClear communication about risks and benefits is crucial before any\ntreatment is initiated.

In all\nscenarios where recommendations for individual interventions to\nreduce risk are ‘strong’ (class I or IIa), it is important to realize that\nmany patients who have received appropriate risk information often\n(in up to 50% of cases, some studies suggest) consciously opt to\nforego the proposed intervention. This applies not only to lifestyle\nmeasures, but also to drug interventions. Apparently, what professio-\nnals feel is sufficient risk reduction for a reasonable effort or initiation\nof a drug with few side-effects does not always correspond to\npatients’ views. The reverse is also true: not only may some patients\nat (very) high risk forego interventions, some patients with low-to-\nmoderate risk may be highly motivated to decrease their risk even\nfurther. Hence, treatment recommendations are never ‘imperative’\nfor (very) high risk patients, nor are interventions ever ‘prohibited’\nfor patients at low-to-moderate risk. There is evidence that a higher\nproportion of women, compared to men, have a low awareness of\ntheir CVD risk and the need for therapeutic interventions. This war-\nrants efforts to improve awareness, risk assessment, and treatment in\nwomen.52,346\u0002351\n4.2. Optimizing cardiovascular risk\nmanagement\n4.2.1. Goals of clinicianpatient communication\nClinicians should provide a personalized presentation of guidelines to\nimprove understanding, encourage lifestyle changes, and support\nadherence to drug therapy. Applying this in daily practice faces differ-\nent barriers.352 Patients’ ability to adopt a healthy lifestyle depends\non cognitive and emotional factors, the impact of a diagnosis or symp-\ntoms, socioeconomic factors, educational level, and mental health.\nPerceived susceptibility to illness and the anticipated severity of the\nconsequences\nare\nalso\nprominent\ncomponents\nof\npatients’\nmotivation.353\n4.2.2. How to improve motivation?\nCommunication strategies such as motivational interviewing are use-\nful.354 Consultation sessions may include a family member or friend,\nespecially for elderly patients. Connection is paramount: focus before\ngreeting; listen intently; agree on what matters most; connect with the\nperson’s story; and explore emotions.355 The OARS (Open-ended\nquestions, Affirmation, Reflective listening, and Summarizing) principle\nhelps patients to present their perceptions, and clinicians to summa-\nrize. The SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, Timely)\nprinciple may help with setting goals for behavioural change.353,356\nHealthcare professionals must consider capability, opportunity (physi-\ncal, social, or environmental) and motivation for behavioural\nchange.357 Multidisciplinary behavioural approaches that combine the\nknowledge and skills of different caregivers are recommended.358\n4.2.3. Optimizing drug adherence\nMedication adherence ranges from 50% for primary ASCVD preven-\ntion to 66% for secondary prevention.359 Physicians should consider\nnon-adherence in every patient and inquire non-judgmentally about\nit.360 Approximately 9% of cases of ASCVD in Europe can be attrib-\nuted to poor medication adherence.361 Contributors to non-\nadherence include polypharmacy, complexity of drug/dose regimes,\npoor doctor-patient relationship, lack of disease acceptance, beliefs\nabout consequences and side-effects, intellectual/cognitive abilities,\nmental disorders, physical limitations, financial aspects, and living\nalone.360,362\u0002364 Importantly, only substantial risk reduction moti-\nvates patients for preventive drug treatment, which obviates the\nneed for appropriate risk communication.365,366 Depression is\nanother important factor, and adequate treatment thereof improves\nadherence.367,368\nMobile phone applications may improve adherence to both medi-\ncation and behavioural changes.369 Their use is easy and probably\ncost-effective.370\n4.2.4. Treatment goals\nIn the subsequent sections, different domains of individual treatment\nare discussed. Table 6 summarizes the treatment goals and some key\ninterventions for different categories of patients. For additional infor-\nmation on risk categories and the principle of a stepwise approach to\ntreatment targets, please refer to section 3.2.3.1. For details on treat-\nment goals, how to achieve them, strengths of recommendations and\nlevels of supporting evidence, please go to the relevant subsections.\n4.3.Optimizing lifestyle\n4.3.1. Physical activity and exercise\nPA reduces the risk of many adverse health outcomes and risk factors\nin all ages and both sexes. There is an inverse relationship between\nmoderate-to-vigorous PA and all-cause mortality, CV morbidity and\nRecommendations for physical activity\nRecommendations\nClassa\nLevelb\nIt is recommended for adults of all ages to strive\nfor at least 150 - 300 min a week of moderate-\nintensity or 75 - 150 min a week of vigorous-\nintensity aerobic PA, or an equivalent combina-\ntion thereof, to reduce all-cause mortality, CV\nmortality, and morbidity.371,372\nI\nA\nIt is recommended that adults who cannot per-\nform 150 min of moderate-intensity PA a week\nshould stay as active as their abilities and health\ncondition allow.373,374\nI\nB\nIt is recommended to reduce sedentary time to\nengage in at least light activity throughout the\nday to reduce all-cause and CV mortality and\nmorbidity.375\u0002377\nI\nB\nPerforming resistance exercise, in addition to\naerobic activity, is recommended on 2 or more\ndays per week to reduce all-cause\nmortality.378,379\nI\nB\nLifestyle interventions, such as group or individ-\nual education, behaviour-change techniques, tel-\nephone counselling, and use of consumer-based\nwearable activity trackers, should be considered\nto increase PA participation.380\u0002382\nIIa\nB\nCV = cardiovascular; PA = physical activity.\naClass of recommendation.\nbLevel of evidence.\nESC 2021\n..........................................................................................................\n3268\nESC Guidelines\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/34/3227/6358713 by guest on 14 January 2026",

This is also the case when replacing meat\nand dairy foods.406,407 Polyunsaturated fats (-25%), monounsaturated\nfats (-15%), and to a lesser extent carbohydrates from whole grains\n(-9%), were all associated with reduced CHD risk when isocalorically\nsubstituted for dietary saturated fat.408,409\nReducing saturated fatty acid intake to less than 10% of energy\nmay have additional benefits.405 However, the LDL-C-lowering effect\nof substituting polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) for saturated fatty\nacids may be less in obese (5.3%) than in normal-weight persons\n(9.7%).421\nTrans fatty acids, formed during industrial processing of fats, have\nunfavourable effects on total cholesterol (increase) and HDL-C\n(decrease). On average, a 2% increase in energy intake from trans\nfatty acids is associated with a 23% higher CHD risk.422 A regulation\nof the European Union (EU) Commission has set the upper limit to 2\ng per 100 g of fat (April 2019) (https://ec.europa.eu/food/safety/label-\nling_nutrition/trans-fat-food_en).\nWhen guidelines to lower saturated fat intake are followed, reduc-\ntions in dietary cholesterol intake follow.\n4.3.2.2 Minerals and vitamins\nA reduction in sodium intake may reduce SBP by, on average, 5.8\nmmHg in hypertensive, and 1.9 mmHg in normotensive patients.410\nThe DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) trial showed\na dose\u0002response relation between sodium reduction and BP\nreduction.423 In a meta-analysis, salt reduction of 2.5 g/day resulted in\na 20% reduction of ASCVD events (RR 0.80).410 A U- or J-shaped\nrelation between a low salt intake and ASCVD is debated.424\nUnderlying illness and malnutrition may explain both low food and\nsalt intakes as well as increased ASCVD.410,425,426 The totality of evi-\ndence warrants salt reduction to prevent CHD and stroke.\nIn most Western countries, salt intake is high (\u00049\u000210 g/day),\nwhereas the recommended maximum intake is 5 g/day. Optimal\nintake might be as low as \u00043 g/day. Salt reduction can be achieved by\ndietary choices (fewer processed foods) and the reformulation of\nfoods by lowering their salt content (see section 5.2.2).\nPotassium (e.g. in fruits and vegetables) has favourable effects on\nBP and risk of stroke (RR 0.76).427\nAs for vitamins, observational studies have found inverse associa-\ntions between vitamins A and E and risk of ASCVD. However, inter-\nvention trials have failed to confirm these findings. Also, trials of\nsupplementation with B vitamins (B6, folic acid, and B12), and vita-\nmins C and D have not shown beneficial effects.428,429\n4.3.2.3 Fibre\nEach 7 g/day higher intake of total fibre is associated with a 9% lower\nrisk of CAD (RR 0.91).430 A 10 g/day higher fibre intake was associ-\nated with a 16% lower risk of stroke (RR 0.84) and a 6% lower risk of\ntype 2 DM (RR 0.94).431,432 A high fibre intake may reduce postpran-\ndial glucose responses after carbohydrate-rich meals and also lower\ntriglyceride levels.433\n4.3.2.4 Specific foods and food groups\n4.3.2.4.1.

Nuts. A meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies sug-\ngested that daily consumption of 30 g of (mixed) nuts was associated\nwith a \u000430% lower risk of ASCVD.437 Both pulses and nuts contain\nfibre and other bioactive components.438\n4.3.2.4.3. Meat. From both a health and an environmental point of\nview, a lower consumption of meat, especially processed meat, is rec-\nommended.411 A restriction of red meat may have little or no effect\non major cardiometabolic outcomes.416 However, substituting red\nmeat with high-quality plant foods (i.e. nuts, soy, and legumes) does\nimprove LDL-C concentrations.406 A recent analysis showed that\nhigher intake of processed meat and unprocessed red meat is associ-\nated with a 7% and 3%, respectively, increased risk of ASCVD.417\nBy reducing processed meats, salt intake will also be reduced. The\nWorld Cancer Research Fund recommends limiting red meat con-\nsumption to 350\u0002500 g per week.439\n4.3.2.4.4. Fish and fish oil supplements. Studies indicate that eating\nfish, particularly fish rich in n-3 PUFA, at least once a week, is associ-\nated with a 16% lower risk of CAD,418 and eating fish two to four\ntimes a week is associated with a 6% lower risk of stroke.440 The\nhighest risk was observed in the range of no or very low intakes.\nSeveral meta-analyses and a recent Cochrane review showed no\nbenefits of fish oils on CV outcomes and/or mortality,441\u0002443\nalthough a 7% lower risk of CHD events was observed. A meta-anal-\nysis of 13 RCTs included the results of VITAL (Vitamin D and\nOmega-3 Trial), ASCEND (A Study of Cardiovascular Events in\nDiabetes), and REDUCE-IT (Reduction of Cardiovascular Events\nwith Icosapent Ethyl\u0002Intervention Trial).444 In the analysis excluding\nREDUCE-IT, fish oil reduced total ASCVD (RR 0.97) and CHD death\n(RR 0.92).444 Including REDUCE-IT (a study done in participants with\nhigh triglycerides, comparing very high icosapent ethyl doses vs. min-\neral oil placebo) strengthened the results.444 However, this is the\nonly study that tested a high icosapent ethyl dose and questions have\nbeen raised regarding the choice of placebo. Very recently,\nSTRENGTH (Long-Term Outcomes Study to Assess Statin Residual\nRisk with Epanova in High Cardiovascular Risk Patients with\nHypertriglyceridemia) failed to demonstrate benefit of a combined\neicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid preparation.445\n4.3.2.4.5. Alcoholic beverages. The upper safe limit of drinking alco-\nholic beverages is about 100 g of pure alcohol per week. How this\ntranslates into number of drinks depends on portion size, the stand-\nards of which differ per country, mostly between 8 and 14 g per\ndrink. This limit is similar for men and women.413 Drinking above this\nlimit lowers life expectancy.\nResults from epidemiological studies have suggested that, whereas\nhigher alcohol consumption is roughly linearly associated with a\nhigher risk of all stroke subtypes, coronary disease, HF, and several\nless common CVD subtypes, it appeared approximately log-linearly\nassociated with a lower risk of myocardial infarction.413 Moreover,\nMendelian randomization studies do not support the apparently pro-\ntective effects of moderate amounts vs. no alcohol against ASCVD,\nsuggesting that the lowest risks for CVD outcomes are in abstainers\nand that any amount of alcohol uniformly increases BP and\nBMI.414,415 These data challenge the concept that moderate alcohol\nconsumption is universally associated with lower CVD risk.\nTrans fat (2%)\nMUFA (5%)\nPUFA (5%)\nCarbohydrates from refined\nstarches/sugars (5%)\nCarbohydrates from whole\ngrains (5%)\nChanges in risk (%)\n-35\n-30\n-25\n-20\n-15\n-10\n-5\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\nFigure 10 Estimated percentage change in risk of coronary heart disease associated with isocaloric substitutions of saturated fat for other types of fat\nor carbohydrates.

Soft drinks and sugar. Regular consumption of sugar-\nsweetened beverages (i.e. two servings per day compared with one\nserving per month) was associated with a 35% higher risk of CAD in\nwomen in the Nurses’ Health Study, whereas artificially sweetened\nbeverages were not associated with CAD. In the EPIC (European\nProspective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition) cohort, both arti-\nficially and sugar-sweetened soft drinks were associated with all-cause\nmortality, while only the former was associated with circulatory dis-\neases.419 The WHO guideline recommends a maximum intake of 10%\nof energy from free sugars (mono- and disaccharides), which includes\nadded sugars as well as sugars present in fruit juices.420\n4.3.2.4.7. Coffee. Non-filtered coffee contains LDL-C-raising cafestol\nand kahweol, and may be associated with an up to 25% increased risk\nof ASCVD mortality by consumption of nine or more drinks a day.446\nNon-filtered coffee includes boiled, Greek, and Turkish coffee and\nsome espresso coffees.

Very brief advice may be\nadvantageous when time is limited (Table 9). A major impetus for ces-\nsation occurs at the time of diagnosis or treatment of CVD.\nPrompting a person to try to quit, brief reiteration of CV and other\nbenefits of quitting, and agreeing on a specific plan with a follow-up\narrangement are evidence-based interventions.\nSmokers who quit may expect an average weight gain of 5 kg, but\nthe health benefits of tobacco cessation outweigh risks from weight\ngain.495 Persistent or reuptake of smoking is common in patients with\nCHD, in particular in those with severe depression and environmen-\ntal exposures.498 Mood-management therapies may improve out-\ncomes in patients with current or past depression.499\n4.5.2. Evidence-based drug interventions\nDrug support for stopping smoking should be considered in all smokers\nwho are ready to undertake this action. Evidence-based drug interven-\ntions include nicotine-replacement therapy (NRT), bupropion, vareni-\ncline, and cytisine (not widely available).489\u0002491 All forms of NRT\n(chewing gum, transdermal nicotine patches, nasal spray, inhaler, sublin-\ngual tablets) are effective. Combination vs. single-form NRT and 4 mg\nvs. 2 mg gum can increase success.492 NRT shows no adverse effects in\npatients with ASCVD,493 but evidence of efficacy in this group is incon-\nclusive.494 In patients with ASCVD, varenicline (RR 2.6), bupropion (RR\n1.4), telephone therapy (RR 1.5), and individual counselling (RR 1.6) all\nincrease success rates.494 The antidepressant, bupropion, aids long-\nterm smoking cessation with similar efficacy to NRT.490\nVarenicline 1 mg b.i.d. (twice a day) increases quitting rates more\nthan two-fold compared with placebo.491 The RR for abstinence vs.\nNRT was 1.25 and vs. bupropion, 1.4. Lower or variable doses are\nalso effective and reduce side-effects. Varenicline beyond the 12-\nweek standard regimen is well tolerated. Varenicline initiated in hos-\npital following ACS is efficacious and safe.500\nThe main side-effect of varenicline is nausea, but this usually sub-\nsides. A causal link between varenicline and neuropsychiatric adverse\nevents is unlikely.501 Varenicline, bupropion, and NRT do not\nincrease serious CV adverse event risks during or after treatment.502\nCytisine is effective for smoking cessation, but evidence to date is\nlimited.491\n4.5.2.1 Electronic cigarettes\nElectronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) simulate combustible cigarettes\nby heating nicotine and other chemicals into a vapour. E-cigarettes\ndeliver nicotine without most of the tobacco chemicals, and are\nprobably less harmful than tobacco.\nRecent evidence suggests that e-cigarettes are probably more\neffective than NRT in terms of smoking cessation.503\u0002505 The long-\nterm effects of e-cigarettes on CV and pulmonary health, however,\nrequire more research.506 Dual use with cigarettes should be\navoided. Furthermore, as e-cigarettes are addictive, their use should\nbe subject to similar marketing controls as standard cigarettes, espe-\ncially the flavoured varieties that appeal to children.507 Despite being\nlower in toxicants than regular cigarettes, ‘heat-not-burn’ cigarettes\ndo contain tobacco and should be discouraged.\n4.6. Lipids\nThis section covers recommendations for the diagnosis and treat-\nment of unfavourable blood lipid levels.

The causal role of LDL-C, and other apo-\nB-containing lipoproteins, in the development of ASCVD is demon-\nstrated beyond any doubt by genetic, observational, and interven-\ntional studies.20 Meta-analysis of clinical trials has indicated that the\nrelative reduction in CVD risk is proportional to the absolute reduc-\ntion of LDL-C, irrespective of the drug(s) used to achieve such\nchange, with no evidence of a lower limit for LDL-C values or ‘J-curve’\neffect.21 The absolute benefit of lowering LDL-C depends on the\nabsolute risk of ASCVD and the absolute reduction in LDL-C, so\neven a small absolute reduction in LDL-C may translate to significant\nabsolute risk reduction in a high- or very-high-risk patient.22 A recent\nLDL-C target-driven RCT in patients after ischaemic stroke or transi-\nent ischaemic attack (TIA) demonstrated a target LDL-C level of <1.8\nmmol/L (70 mg/dL) with the use of statin and, if required, ezetimibe,\nwas associated with a lower CVD risk than those who had a target\nrange of 2.3\u00022.8 mmol/L (90\u0002110 mg/dL).508 Studies on the clinical\nsafety of (very) low achieved LDL-C values have not caused particular\nconcerns, although monitoring for longer periods is required.\n4.6.1.

In patients with low LDL-C lev-\nels and/or hypertriglyceridaemia (<_800 mg/dL), alternative formulae\nare available511,512 or LDL-C can be measured directly.\n4.6.1.3 Non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol\nThe non-HDL-C value is calculated by subtracting HDL-C from total\ncholesterol. Non-HDL-C, unlike LDL-C, does not require the trigly-\nceride concentration to be <4.5 mmol/L (400 mg/dL). It also has an\nadvantage in that it is accurate in a non-fasting setting, and may be\nmore accurate in patients with DM. There is evidence for a role\nof non-HDL-C as a treatment target as it captures the information\nregarding all apolipoprotein-B-containing lipoproteins.513 We suggest\nit as a reasonable alternative treatment goal for all patients, particularly\nfor those with hypertriglyceridaemia or DM. How non-HDL-C levels\ncorrespond to commonly used LDL-C goals is shown in Table 10.\n4.6.1.4 Apolipoprotein B\nApolipoprotein B provides a direct estimate of the total concentra-\ntion of atherogenic lipid particles, particularly in patients with ele-\nvated triglycerides. However, on average, the information conferred\nby apolipoprotein B is similar to that of calculated LDL-C.514\nHow apolipoprotein B levels correspond to commonly used LDL-C\ngoals is shown in Table 10.\n4.6.2. Defining lipid goals\n4.6.2.1 Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goals\nLDL-C goals are summarized in the recommendations below. As not\nall drugs are tolerated or available/affordable, treatment should focus\non achieving LDL-C levels as close as possible to the given goals.\nTreatment should be a shared decision-making process between\nphysicians and the patient.\nAs explained earlier in these guidelines (section 3.2.3.1), we propose\na stepwise approach to treatment goals, also for LDL-C (Figures 6\u00028).\nThis approach may seem novel but, in reality, resembles clinical prac-\ntice, where treatment intensification is considered based on anticipated\nbenefit, side-effects, and—importantly—patient preferences. The ulti-\nmate lipid goals are the same as in the 2019 ESC/EAS dyslipidaemia\nGuidelines.3 Evidence from glucose-lowering treatment studies indi-\ncates that stepwise treatment does not compromise goal attainment,\nand is associated with fewer side-effects and higher patient satisfac-\ntion.66,67 In specific cases (at very high risk), the physician may opt to\nmerge both steps and proceed directly to the low LDL-C target level\nof STEP 2. In apparently healthy people, lifetime treatment benefit of\nLDL-C reduction may play a role in shared decision-making, together\nwith risk modifiers, comorbidities, patient preference, and frailty. Figure\n12 may support decision-making, as it shows the estimated lifetime\nbenefits in years-free-of-CVD in relation to the total CVD risk profile,\ncalibrated in low-to-moderate CVD risk countries.\nAfter STEP 1, treatment intensification with STEP 2 must be con-\nsidered in all patients.

In patients with low LDL-C lev-\nels and/or hypertriglyceridaemia (<_800 mg/dL), alternative formulae\nare available511,512 or LDL-C can be measured directly.\n4.6.1.3 Non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol\nThe non-HDL-C value is calculated by subtracting HDL-C from total\ncholesterol. Non-HDL-C, unlike LDL-C, does not require the trigly-\nceride concentration to be <4.5 mmol/L (400 mg/dL). It also has an\nadvantage in that it is accurate in a non-fasting setting, and may be\nmore accurate in patients with DM. There is evidence for a role\nof non-HDL-C as a treatment target as it captures the information\nregarding all apolipoprotein-B-containing lipoproteins.513 We suggest\nit as a reasonable alternative treatment goal for all patients, particularly\nfor those with hypertriglyceridaemia or DM. How non-HDL-C levels\ncorrespond to commonly used LDL-C goals is shown in Table 10.\n4.6.1.4 Apolipoprotein B\nApolipoprotein B provides a direct estimate of the total concentra-\ntion of atherogenic lipid particles, particularly in patients with ele-\nvated triglycerides. However, on average, the information conferred\nby apolipoprotein B is similar to that of calculated LDL-C.514\nHow apolipoprotein B levels correspond to commonly used LDL-C\ngoals is shown in Table 10.\n4.6.2. Defining lipid goals\n4.6.2.1 Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goals\nLDL-C goals are summarized in the recommendations below. As not\nall drugs are tolerated or available/affordable, treatment should focus\non achieving LDL-C levels as close as possible to the given goals.\nTreatment should be a shared decision-making process between\nphysicians and the patient.\nAs explained earlier in these guidelines (section 3.2.3.1), we propose\na stepwise approach to treatment goals, also for LDL-C (Figures 6\u00028).\nThis approach may seem novel but, in reality, resembles clinical prac-\ntice, where treatment intensification is considered based on anticipated\nbenefit, side-effects, and—importantly—patient preferences. The ulti-\nmate lipid goals are the same as in the 2019 ESC/EAS dyslipidaemia\nGuidelines.3 Evidence from glucose-lowering treatment studies indi-\ncates that stepwise treatment does not compromise goal attainment,\nand is associated with fewer side-effects and higher patient satisfac-\ntion.66,67 In specific cases (at very high risk), the physician may opt to\nmerge both steps and proceed directly to the low LDL-C target level\nof STEP 2. In apparently healthy people, lifetime treatment benefit of\nLDL-C reduction may play a role in shared decision-making, together\nwith risk modifiers, comorbidities, patient preference, and frailty. Figure\n12 may support decision-making, as it shows the estimated lifetime\nbenefits in years-free-of-CVD in relation to the total CVD risk profile,\ncalibrated in low-to-moderate CVD risk countries.\nAfter STEP 1, treatment intensification with STEP 2 must be con-\nsidered in all patients. Given that lower is better, we encourage liberal\nintensification of treatment, particularly if submaximal doses of (low-\ncost) generic statins are used and side-effects are not apparent.\nThe treatment goal of LDL-C <1.4 mmol/L (55 mg/dL) in STEP 2,\nin patients with established ASCVD or without ASCVD but at very\nhigh risk, is lower than the lowest LDL-C goal of 1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/\ndL) in the 2016 ESC prevention Guidelines.2 This low goal was estab-\nlished based on data from recent Mendelian randomization studies,80\nmeta-analyses\nfrom\nthe\nCholesterol\nTreatment\nTrialists’\nCollaboration,21 RCTs such as IMPROVE-IT (Improved Reduction of\nOutcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial),515 and—more\nrecently—proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9)\ninhibitor clinical outcome studies.516\u0002518 The class and level of evi-\ndence supporting this LDL-C target of <1.4 mmol/L (55 mg/dL) for\npatients with ASCVD is identical to that in the recent ESC/EAS dysli-\npidaemia guidelines.3 For primary prevention in very-high-risk\npatients, however, the class of recommendation is lower (Class I in\nthe dyslipidaemia guidelines, Class IIa in the current guidelines),\nbecause the Task Force was less unanimous with regards to this low\nLDL-C target in the primary prevention context.\nFor patients with ASCVD who experience a second vascular event\nwithin 2 years (not necessarily of the same type as the first) while tak-\ning maximum tolerated statin-based therapy, an even lower LDL-C\ngoal of <1.0 mmol/L (40 mg/dL) may be considered. Importantly,\nthere are no differences in the RR reductions between men and\nwomen and between younger and older patients (at least up to age\n75 years), or between those with and without DM.3\n4.6.2.2 Triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and their remnants\nThere are no treatment goals for triglycerides, but <1.7 mmol/L (150\nmg/dL) is considered to indicate lower risk, whereas higher levels\nindicate a need to look for other risk factors.\n4.6.2.3 High-density lipoprotein cholesterol\nTo date, no specific goals for HDL-C levels have been determined in\nclinical trials, although low HDL-C is associated with (residual) risk in\nASCVD patients. PA and other lifestyle factors, rather than drug\ntreatment, remain important means of increasing HDL-C levels.\nRecommendation on low-density lipoprotein choles-\nterol goalsa\nRecommendation\nClassb\nLevelc\nA stepwise treatment-intensiﬁcation approach is\nrecommended for apparently healthy people at\nhigh or very high CVD risk, as well as patients\nwith established ASCVD and/or DM with con-\nsideration of CVD risk, treatment beneﬁt, risk\nmodiﬁers, comorbidities, and patient\npreferences.\nI\nC\nASCVD = atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; DM = diabetes mellitus.\naRecommendation from section 3.2.\nbClass of recommendation.\ncLevel of evidence.\nESC 2021\n3276\nESC Guidelines\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/34/3227/6358713 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n1.2 1.4 1.6 1.7\n0.9 1.1 1.3 1.5\n1.3 1.4 1.5 1.6\n1.6\n0.7 0.9 1.0 1.1\n0.9 1.1 1.3 1.3\n1.1 1.3 1.4 1.5\n0.9 1.0 1.2 1.3\n1.0 1.2 1.4 1.5\n1.2 1.4 1.5 1.6\n1.3 1.5\n1.7\n1.5 1.7 1.8 1.9\n0.9 1.0 1.2 1.3\n1.1 1.3 1.5 1.6\n1.3 1.4 1.6 1.7\n1.4 1.6 1.7 1.8\n0.9 1.1 1.3 1.4\n1.4 1.5 1.8 1.9\n1.5 1.7 1.8 1.9\n1.1 1.3 1.5 1.6\n1.3 1.6 1.7 1.8\n1.5 1.7 1.9 2.0\n0.9 1.2 1.4 1.5\n1.4 1.5 1.7 1.8\n1.2 1.4 1.6 1.7\n0.6 0.7 0.9 0.9\n0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7\n0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8\n0.9\n0.2 0.3 0.3 0.3\n0.2 0.3 0.5 0.5\n0.4 0.5 0.6 0.6\n0.3 0.4 0.4 0.6\n0.3 0.5 0.5 0.6\n0.5 0.6 0.7 0.7\n0.6 0.7\n0.9\n0.8 1.0 1.1 1.2\n0.3 0.4 0.4 0.6\n0.4 0.5 0.7 0.7\n0.5 0.7 0.8 0.9\n0.6 0.8 0.9 1.1\n0.4 0.4 0.6 0.6\n0.7 0.9 1.1 1.1\n0.9 1.0 1.3 1.4\n0.5 0.6 0.8 0.8\n0.6 0.8 0.9 1.1\n0.9 1.1 1.3 1.4\n0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8\n0.8 0.9 1.1 1.2\n0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9\n0.8 1.0 1.1 1.3\n0.6 0.7 0.9 1.0\n0.8 0.9 1.1 1.1\n1.2\n0.4 0.5 0.6 0.6\n0.5 0.6 0.7 0.9\n0.7 0.8 1.0 1.0\n0.5 0.7 0.7 0.8\n0.6 0.8 0.8 1.0\n0.8 1.0 1.0 1.1\n0.9 1.1\n1.3\n1.1 1.3 1.4 1.6\n0.5 0.7 0.7 0.8\n0.7 0.8 1.0 1.1\n0.8 1.0 1.2 1.2\n1.1 1.2 1.4 1.4\n0.6 0.6 0.8 0.9\n1.0 1.2 1.3 1.5\n1.2 1.4 1.5 1.6\n0.7 0.9 1.1 1.2\n0.9 1.1 1.3 1.4\n1.2 1.4 1.6 1.6\n0.6 0.8 0.9 1.0\n1.0 1.2 1.4 1.5\n0.8 1.0 1.1 1.2\n0.6 0.7 0.9 0.9\n0.4 0.5 0.6 0.6\n0.3 0.4 0.5 0.5\n0.7\n0.1 0.2 0.3 0.2\n0.2 0.2 0.3 0.4\n0.2 0.3 0.4 0.4\n0.3 0.4 0.5 0.4\n0.3 0.4 0.4 0.4\n0.4 0.5 0.5 0.6\n0.5 0.5\n0.7\n0.8 0.9 1.0 1.1\n0.3 0.4 0.5 0.4\n0.4 0.5 0.6 0.6\n0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8\n0.6 0.7 0.9 0.9\n0.3 0.5 0.5 0.6\n0.7 0.8 0.9 1.1\n0.9 1.0 1.2 1.3\n0.4 0.6 0.7 0.8\n0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9\n0.9 1.1 1.3 1.4\n0.5 0.6 0.6 0.8\n0.7 0.9 1.1 1.2\n0.6 0.7 0.7 0.8\n0.3 0.4 0.4 0.4\n0.8 0.8 0.9 0.9\n0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2\n0.2 0.3 0.3 0.3\n0.3 0.3 0.4 0.4\n0.4 0.4 0.5 0.6\n0.5 0.6 0.7 0.7\n0.6 0.7 0.8 0.8\n0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0\n0.9 1.0 1.1 1.1\n1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3\n1.4\n1.2 1.3\n1.4\n0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8\n0.6 0.8 0.9 1.0\n0.8 1.0 1.1 1.2\n1.0 1.2 1.3\n1.4\n0.1 0.1 0.2 0.2\n0.2 0.2 0.3 0.4\n0.0 0.0 0.1 0.1\n0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1\n0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1\n0.0 0.1 0.1 0.1\n0.1 0.2 0.2 0.2\n0.1 0.2 0.2 0.3\n0.2 0.2 0.3 0.2\n0.2 0.3 0.3 0.4\n0.2 0.4 0.4 0.5\n0.5\n0.4 0.5\n0.6\n0.1 0.1 0.2 0.2\n0.2 0.2 0.2 0.3\n0.2 0.2 0.3 0.4\n0.2 0.3 0.5\n0.5\n0.2 0.3 0.3 0.3\n0.4 0.5 0.5 0.5\n0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1\n0.1 0.1 0.2 0.2\n0.2 0.2 0.2 0.3\n0.2 0.2 0.3 0.3\n0.3 0.4 0.4 0.4\n0.3 0.4 0.5 0.5\n0.4 0.4 0.5 0.5\n0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7\n0.5 0.6 0.7 0.7\n0.9\n0.7 0.8\n1.0\n0.2 0.3 0.4 0.4\n0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6\n0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7\n0.6 0.6 0.7\n0.9\n0.1 0.0 0.1 0.1\n0.1 0.1 0.1 0.2\n0.0 0.1 0.0 0.1\n0.1 0.0 0.0 0.1\n0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0\n0.0 0.0 0.0 0.1\n0.0 0.0 0.1 0.1\n0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1\n0.0 0.1 0.1 0.1\n0.1 0.1 0.2 0.2\n0.1 0.2 0.2 0.2\n0.3\n0.2 0.2\n0.3\n0.0 0.0 0.0 0.1\n0.1 0.1 0.2 0.1\n0.1 0.2 0.2 0.2\n0.2 0.2 0.3\n0.3\n1.0 1.2 1.4 1.5\n1.2 1.4 1.6 1.7\n1.4 1.5 1.7 1.8\n1.6 1.7 1.9 2.0\n0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8\n0.6 0.8 0.9 1.0\n0.8 0.9 1.1 1.2\n0.9 1.1 1.3 1.4\n0.6 0.8 0.9 1.0\n0.8 1.0 1.1 1.3\n1.0 1.2 1.4 1.5\n1.3 1.4 1.6 1.7\n0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8\n0.6 0.8 0.9 1.0\n0.8 0.9 1.1 1.3\n0.9 1.2 1.4 1.5\n160-179\n140-159\n120-139\n100-119\n160-179\n140-159\n120-139\n100-119\n160-179\n140-159\n120-139\n100-119\n160-179\n140-159\n120-139\n100-119\n160-179\n140-159\n120-139\n100-119\n160-179\n140-159\n120-139\n100-119\n160-179\n140-159\n120-139\n100-119\n160-179\n140-159\n120-139\n100-119\n160-179\n140-159\n120-139\n100-119\n160-179\n140-159\n120-139\n100-119\n90+\n85-89\n80-84\n75-79\n70-74\n65-69\n60-64\n55-59\n50-54\n45-49\nSystolic blood\npressure (mmHg)\nNon-smoking\nSmoking\nAge\n(y)\nLIFE-CVD model\nCVD-free lifetime gain from 1 mmol/L\nLDL-C reduction (in years)\nNon-smoking\nSmoking\nNon-HDL cholesterol\nWomen\nMen\nmmol/L\n150 200 250\n150 200 250\n150 200 250\n150 200 250\nmg/dL\n< 0.5 years\n0.5 - 0.9 years\n1.0 - 1.4 years\n1.5 - 2.0 years\n≥2.0 years\n160-179\n140-159\n120-139\n100-119\n40-44\n3.0-3.9\n4.0-4.9\n5.0-5.9\n6.0-6.9\n3.0-3.9\n4.0-4.9\n5.0-5.9\n6.0-6.9\n3.0-3.9\n4.0-4.9\n5.0-5.9\n6.0-6.9\n3.0-3.9\n4.0-4.9\n5.0-5.9\n6.0-6.9\nFigure 12 Average years-free-of-cardiovascular disease gained per 1 mmol/L (40 mg/dL) low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction in apparently\nhealthy persons.

Strategies to control dyslipidaemias\nThe presence of dyslipidaemias secondary to other conditions must\nbe excluded before beginning treatment, as treatment of underlying\ndisease may improve hyperlipidaemia without requiring lipid-\nlowering therapy. This is particularly true for hypothyroidism.\nSecondary dyslipidaemias can also be caused by alcohol abuse, DM,\nCushing’s syndrome, diseases of the liver and kidneys, as well as by\ndrugs (e.g. corticosteroids). In addition, lifestyle optimization is crucial\nin all patients with higher than optimal lipid levels.\n4.6.3.1 Strategies to control low-density lipoprotein cholesterol\n4.6.3.1.1. Diet and lifestyle modifications. Dietary factors influence\nthe development of ASCVD, either directly or through their action\non traditional risk factors, such as plasma lipids, BP, or glucose levels.\nConsistent evidence from epidemiological studies indicates that\nhigher consumption of fruit, non-starchy vegetables, nuts, legumes,\nfish, vegetable oils, yoghurt, and wholegrains, along with a lower\nintake of red and processed meats, foods higher in refined carbohy-\ndrates, and salt, is associated with a lower incidence of CV events.519\nMoreover, the replacement of animal fats, including dairy fat, with\nvegetable sources of fats and PUFAs may decrease the risk of\nASCVD.407 More detail on lifestyle recommendations can be found\nearlier in this section.\n4.6.3.1.2. Drugs for treatment of dyslipidaemias. The currently\navailable lipid-lowering drugs include inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-meth-\nylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (statins), fibrates, bile acid seques-\ntrants, selective cholesterol absorption inhibitors (e.g. ezetimibe),\nand—more recently—PCSK9 inhibitors. Bempedoic acid, an oral\ncholesterol synthesis inhibitor, has recently been approved in several\ncountries. Usage is mainly intended in combination with ezetimibe in\npatients with statin intolerance. ASCVD outcome trials are not\nexpected before the end of 2022. Additionally, inclisiran, a new small\ninterfering ribonucleic acid, has shown to reduce LDL-C by 50\u000255%\nwhen applied subcutaneously twice a year. These results were\nobtained either on top of statin or without other lipid-lowering\ntherapies, and with almost no side-effects. Inclisiran has been\napproved in several European countries. Results from the ASCVD\noutcomes trial are expected for 2023.\nThe expected LDL-C reductions in response to therapy are\nshown in Figure 13, and may vary widely among individuals.\nTherefore, monitoring the effect on LDL-C levels is recommended,\nwith assessment of LDL-C levels 4 - 6 weeks after any treatment\nstrategy initiation or change.\nTreatment\nAverage LDL-C reduction\nIntensity of lipid-lowering treatment\nModerate-intensity statin\nHigh-intensity statin\nHigh-intensity statin plus ezetimibe\nPCSK9 inhibitor\nPCSK9 inhibitor plus high-intensity statin\nPCSK9 inhibitor plus high-intensity statin plus ezetimibe\n30%\n50%\n65%\n60%\n75%\n85%\nFigure 13 Expected low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reductions for combination therapies.

Statins. Statins decrease LDL-C, thereby reducing ASCVD\nmorbidity and mortality as well as the need for coronary artery inter-\nventions. Statins also lower triglycerides, and may reduce pancreatitis\nrisk. Therefore, they are the drug of first choice in patients at\nincreased risk of ASCVD.3\n4.6.3.1.3.1. Adverse effects, interactions, and adherence to statin\ntherapy\nThe most frequent adverse effect of statin therapy is myopathy, but\nthis is rare. A meta-analysis ruled out any contribution to an increase\nin non-CV mortality.522 Increased blood sugar and HbA1c levels (i.e.\nincreased risk of type 2 DM) can occur after treatment initiation and\nare dose dependent, in part linked to slight weight gain, but the bene-\nfits of statins outweigh the risks for the majority of patients.527\nAdhering to lifestyle changes when prescribed a statin should lessen\nthe risk of DM. Increased levels of liver enzymes may occur during\nstatin therapy, and are usually reversible. Routine monitoring of liver\nenzyme values is not indicated.\nAlthough 5\u000210% of patients receiving statins complain of myalgia,\nin most cases it is not attributable to statins.3 The risk of myopathy\n(severe muscular symptoms) can be minimized by identifying vulner-\nable patients and/or by avoiding statin interactions with specific drugs.\nRhabdomyolysis is extremely rare. As statins are prescribed on a\nlong-term basis, possible interactions with other drugs deserve par-\nticular and continuous attention, as many patients will receive\npharmacological therapy for concomitant conditions. In practice,\nmanagement of a patient with myalgia but without a major increase in\ncreatine kinase is based on trial and error, and usually involves switch-\ning to a different statin or use of a very low dosage several days a\nweek, with a gradual increase in frequency and dosage. A manage-\nment algorithm may help to manage these patients.3\n4.6.3.1.4. Cholesterol absorption inhibitors (ezetimibe). The com-\nbination of statin with ezetimibe brings a benefit that is in line with\nmeta-analyses showing that LDL-C reduction has benefits independ-\nent of the approach used.3,21 The beneficial effect of ezetimibe is also\nsupported by genetic studies.528 Together, these data support the\nposition that ezetimibe should be considered as second-line therapy,\neither on top of statins when the therapeutic goal is not achieved, or\nwhen a statin cannot be prescribed.\n4.6.3.1.5.

Statins. Statins decrease LDL-C, thereby reducing ASCVD\nmorbidity and mortality as well as the need for coronary artery inter-\nventions. Statins also lower triglycerides, and may reduce pancreatitis\nrisk. Therefore, they are the drug of first choice in patients at\nincreased risk of ASCVD.3\n4.6.3.1.3.1. Adverse effects, interactions, and adherence to statin\ntherapy\nThe most frequent adverse effect of statin therapy is myopathy, but\nthis is rare. A meta-analysis ruled out any contribution to an increase\nin non-CV mortality.522 Increased blood sugar and HbA1c levels (i.e.\nincreased risk of type 2 DM) can occur after treatment initiation and\nare dose dependent, in part linked to slight weight gain, but the bene-\nfits of statins outweigh the risks for the majority of patients.527\nAdhering to lifestyle changes when prescribed a statin should lessen\nthe risk of DM. Increased levels of liver enzymes may occur during\nstatin therapy, and are usually reversible. Routine monitoring of liver\nenzyme values is not indicated.\nAlthough 5\u000210% of patients receiving statins complain of myalgia,\nin most cases it is not attributable to statins.3 The risk of myopathy\n(severe muscular symptoms) can be minimized by identifying vulner-\nable patients and/or by avoiding statin interactions with specific drugs.\nRhabdomyolysis is extremely rare. As statins are prescribed on a\nlong-term basis, possible interactions with other drugs deserve par-\nticular and continuous attention, as many patients will receive\npharmacological therapy for concomitant conditions. In practice,\nmanagement of a patient with myalgia but without a major increase in\ncreatine kinase is based on trial and error, and usually involves switch-\ning to a different statin or use of a very low dosage several days a\nweek, with a gradual increase in frequency and dosage. A manage-\nment algorithm may help to manage these patients.3\n4.6.3.1.4. Cholesterol absorption inhibitors (ezetimibe). The com-\nbination of statin with ezetimibe brings a benefit that is in line with\nmeta-analyses showing that LDL-C reduction has benefits independ-\nent of the approach used.3,21 The beneficial effect of ezetimibe is also\nsupported by genetic studies.528 Together, these data support the\nposition that ezetimibe should be considered as second-line therapy,\neither on top of statins when the therapeutic goal is not achieved, or\nwhen a statin cannot be prescribed.\n4.6.3.1.5.

As a result, class and level of evidence\nhave been modified in some age groups, in particular the category of\npatients between 70 and 75 years. Although a single age cut-off is\nnow used, it is important to stress that all such age cut-offs are rela-\ntively arbitrary, and biological age influences this threshold in clinical\npractice. For example, a very fit 75-year-old person may qualify for a\ntreatment normally reserved for those <70 and, conversely, a very\nfrail 65-year-old person should sometimes be considered ‘older’.\nGeneral recommendations for lipid-lowering treatment in older\npatients are summarized below.\nRecent evidence has strengthened the role of LDL-C as an ASCVD\nrisk factor in older patients.537 Evidence from trials indicates that statins\nand other lipid-lowering drugs produce significant reductions in major\nvascular events irrespective of age.538,539 However, there is less direct\nevidence of statin benefit in those without evidence of ASCVD. Under\nthe age of 70 years, statins are recommended for primary prevention\ndepending on the level of risk. Above that age, initiation of statin treat-\nment for primary prevention may be considered when at (very) high\nrisk, but we explicitly recommend also taking other arguments into\naccount, such as risk modifiers, frailty, estimated life-time benefit,\ncomorbidities, and patient preferences (see section 3.2.3.3 and Figure\n12). In case of renal function impairment or risk for drug interactions,\nthe statin dose should be up-titrated carefully. In terms of LDL-C tar-\ngets, there is insufficient evidence to support targets for primary pre-\nvention in older patients. Although the conventional LDL-C target of\n<2.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) may seem reasonable, the results of ongoing\nprimary prevention trials in older patients must be awaited [STAREE\n(STAtin Therapy for Reducing Events in the Elderly) trial; clinicatrials.\ngov registration: NCT02099123].

Statin therapy or statin therapy in combination with\nezetimibe (which allows larger LDL-C reductions without increasing\nthe statin dose) has a beneficial effect on ASCVD outcomes in\nCKD.543 For patients with end-stage renal disease, however, we rec-\nommend that hypolipidaemic therapy should not be initiated (see\nRecommendations below).

However,\nin the presence of premature ASCVD or family history, possible FH\nshould be considered at lower LDL-C levels. Besides genetic testing\n(not always affordable), use of the Dutch Clinical Lipid Network cri-\nteria\n(Table\n11)\nis\nrecommended\nto\nidentify\npossible\nFH.\nHomozygous FH is rare and should always be placed under the care\nof lipid experts.\nTreatment guidelines for people with FH can be found in the 2019\nESC/EAS dyslipidaemia Guidelines.3\n4.7.

More detail and guidance for complex cases/tertiary care are\navailable in the 2018 ESC/European Society of Hypertension (ESH)\nGuidelines for the management of arterial hypertension.4\nSummary of recommendations for the clinical manage-\nment of hypertension\nRecommendations\nClassa\nLevelb\nClassiﬁcation of BP\nIt is recommended that BP should be classiﬁed\nas optimal, normal, high-normal, or grades 1 - 3\nhypertension, according to ofﬁce BP.\nI\nC\nDiagnosis of hypertension\nIt is recommended to base the diagnosis of\nhypertension on:\n\u0007 Repeated ofﬁce BP measurements, on more\nthan one visit, except when hypertension is\nsevere (e.g. grade 3 and especially in high-risk\npatients)\nor\n\u0007 Out-of-ofﬁce BP measurement with ABPM and/\nor HBPM when feasible.\nI\nI\nC\nC\nAssessment of HMOD\nTo evaluate for the presence of HMOD, meas-\nurement of serum creatinine, eGFR, electrolytes,\nand ACR is recommended for all patients. A 12-\nlead ECG is recommended for all patients, and\nechocardiography is recommended for those\nwith ECG abnormalities or signs/symptoms of\nLV dysfunction. Fundoscopy or retinal imaging is\nrecommended for patients with grades 2 or 3\nhypertension and all hypertensive patients with\nDM.548\u0002551\nI\nB\nThresholds for initiation of drug treatment of hypertension\nFor grade 1 hypertension, treatment initiation\nbased on absolute CVD risk, estimated lifetime\nbeneﬁt, and the presence of HMOD is\nrecommended.552,553\nI\nC\nFor patients with grade 2 hypertension or higher,\ndrug treatment is recommended.4,552\nI\nA\nOfﬁce BP treatment targets\nIt is recommended that the ﬁrst objective of\ntreatment is to lower BP to <140/90 mmHg in\nall patients, and that subsequent BP targets are\ntailored to age and speciﬁc comorbidities.552,554\nI\nA\nIn treated patients aged 18\u000269 years, it is rec-\nommended that SBP should ultimately be low-\nered to a target range of 120 - 130 mmHg in\nmost patients.552,554\u0002556\nI\nA\nIn treated patients aged >_70 years, it is recom-\nmended that SBP should generally be targeted to\n<140 and down to 130 mmHg if\ntolerated.552,554,557\nI\nA\nIn all treated patients, DBP is recommended to\nbe lowered to <80 mmHg.555,558,559\nI\nA\nTreatment of hypertension: lifestyle interventions\nLifestyle interventions are recommended for\npeople with high-normal BP or higher.c\nI\nA\nContinued\nTreatment of hypertension: drug treatment\nIt is recommended to initiate antihypertensive\ntreatment with a two-drug combination in most\npatients, preferably as a single-pill combination.\nExceptions are frail older patients and those\nwith low-risk, grade 1 hypertension (particularly\nif SBP <150 mmHg).560\u0002565\nI\nB\nIt is recommended that the preferred combina-\ntions include a RAS blocker (i.e. an ACE inhibitor\nor ARB) with a CCB or diuretic, but other com-\nbinations of the ﬁve major classes can be used\n(ACE inhibitor, ARB, beta-blocker, CCB, thia-\nzide/thiazide-like diuretic).566\u0002569\nI\nA\nIt is recommended, if BP remains uncontrolled\nwith a two-drug combination, that treatment be\nincreased to a three-drug combination, usually a\nRAS blocker with a CCB and a diuretic, prefera-\nbly as a single-pill combination.563,570,571\nI\nA\nIt is recommended, if BP is not controlled by a\nthree-drug combination, that treatment should\nbe increased by the addition of spironolactone,\nor if not tolerated, other diuretics such as ami-\nloride or higher doses of other diuretics, an\nalpha-blocker or beta-blocker, or\nclonidine.555,572\u0002574\nI\nB\nThe combination of two RAS blockers is not\nrecommended.575,576\nIII\nA\nManagement of CVD risk in hypertensive patients\nStatin therapy is recommended for many\npatients with hypertension.d\nSection 4.6\nAntiplatelet therapy is indicated for secondary\nprevention in patients with hypertension.e\nSection 4.9\nABPM = ambulatory blood pressure monitoring; ACE = angiotensin-converting\nenzyme; ACR = albumin-to-creatinine ratio; ARB = angiotensin receptor blocker;\nASCVD = atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; BP = blood pressure; CCB =\ncalcium channel blocker; DBP = diastolic blood pressure; DM = diabetes mellitus;\nECG = electrocardiogram; eGFR = estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate; HBPM =\nhome blood pressure monitoring; HMOD = hypertension-mediated organ dam-\nage; LV = left ventricular; RAS = renin\u0002angiotensin system; SBP = systolic blood\npressure.\naClass of recommendation.\nbLevel of evidence.\ncSee section 4.3 for details.\ndSee section 4.6 for details.\neSee section 4.9 for details.\nESC 2021\n............................................................................................................................................................................\n3282\nESC Guidelines\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/34/3227/6358713 by guest on 14 January 2026",

Definition and classification of hypertension\nBP is classified according to seated office BP (Table 12), with approxi-\nmately corresponding values according to ABPM or home BP average\nvalues in Table 13.\n4.7.2. Blood pressure measurement\n4.7.2.1 Office blood pressure measurement\nOffice BP should be measured in standardized conditions using\nvalidated auscultatory or (semi)automatic devices, as described in\nTable 14.\n4.7.2.2 Unattended automated office blood pressure measurement\nRepeated automated office BP readings may improve the reproduci-\nbility of BP measurement. If the patient is seated alone and unob-\nserved, unattended automated office BP measurement may reduce\nor eliminate the ‘white-coat’ effect, and unattended automated office\nBP measurements are usually lower than conventional office BP\nmeasurements, and more similar to ambulatory daytime BP or home\nBP values. There is limited information on the prognostic value of\nunattended automated office BP measurements.4\n4.7.2.3 Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring\nABPM is the average of repeated automated measurements of BP\nduring the daytime, night-time, and over 24 h. ABPM is a better pre-\ndictor of hypertension-mediated organ damage (HMOD) and clinical\noutcomes than office BP, and identifies ‘white-coat’ hypertension and\nmasked hypertension (see below). Diagnostic thresholds for hyper-\ntension are lower with ABPM than office BP (Table 12).4\n4.7.2.4 Home blood pressure monitoring\nHome BP is the average of all BP readings performed with a validated\nsemiautomatic monitor, for at least 3 consecutive days (ideally 6 - 7\ndays), with readings in the morning and evening, taken seated in a\nquiet room after 5 min of rest. Home BP monitoring (HBPM) thresh-\nolds for the diagnosis of hypertension are lower than those for office\nBP (Table 12). Patient self-monitoring may have a beneficial effect on\nmedication adherence and BP control.4\nClinical indications for ambulatory or home monitoring are shown\nin Table 15.\n4.7.3 Screening and diagnosis of hypertension\nIdeally, all adults should be screened for the presence of hyperten-\nsion,578,579 but most countries lack the required resources and infra-\nstructure. Formally, these guidelines recommend opportunistic\nscreening at least in susceptible individuals, such as those who are\noverweight or have a family history of hypertension (see section 3.1).\nESC 2021\nTable 12\nCategories for conventionally measured seated\nofﬁce blood pressurea\nCategory\nSBP (mmHg)\nDBP (mmHg)\nOptimal\n<120\nand\n<80\nNormal\n120\u0002129\nand/or\n80\u000284\nHigh-normal\n130\u0002139\nand/or\n85\u000289\nGrade 1 hypertension\n140\u0002159\nand/or\n90\u000299\nGrade 2 hypertension\n160\u0002179\nand/or\n100\u0002109\nGrade 3 hypertension\n>_180\nand/or\n>_110\nIsolated systolic\nhypertensionb\n>_140\nand\n<90\nBP = blood pressure; DBP = diastolic blood pressure; SBP = systolic blood pressure.\naBP category is deﬁned according to seated clinic BP and by the highest level of\nBP, whether systolic or diastolic.\nbIsolated systolic hypertension is graded 1, 2, or 3 according to SBP values in the\nranges indicated.\nTable 13\nDeﬁnitions of hypertension according to ofﬁce,\nambulatory, and home blood pressure\nCategory\nSBP\n(mmHg)\nDBP\n(mmHg)\nOfﬁce BPa\n>_140\nand/or\n>_90\nAmbulatory BP\nDaytime (or awake) mean\n>_135\nand/or\n>_85\nNight-time (or asleep) mean\n>_120\nand/or\n>_70\n24-h mean\n>_130\nand/or\n>_80\nHome BP mean\n>_135\nand/or\n>_85\nBP = blood pressure; DBP = diastolic blood pressure; SBP = systolic blood\npressure.\naRefers to conventional ofﬁce BP rather than unattended ofﬁce BP.\nTable 14\nConsiderations in blood pressure\nmeasurement\nPatients should be seated comfortably in a quiet environment for 5 min\nbefore BP measurements.\nThree BP measurements should be recorded, 1\u00022 min apart, and addi-\ntional measurements if the ﬁrst two readings differ by >10 mmHg.

Definition and classification of hypertension\nBP is classified according to seated office BP (Table 12), with approxi-\nmately corresponding values according to ABPM or home BP average\nvalues in Table 13.\n4.7.2. Blood pressure measurement\n4.7.2.1 Office blood pressure measurement\nOffice BP should be measured in standardized conditions using\nvalidated auscultatory or (semi)automatic devices, as described in\nTable 14.\n4.7.2.2 Unattended automated office blood pressure measurement\nRepeated automated office BP readings may improve the reproduci-\nbility of BP measurement. If the patient is seated alone and unob-\nserved, unattended automated office BP measurement may reduce\nor eliminate the ‘white-coat’ effect, and unattended automated office\nBP measurements are usually lower than conventional office BP\nmeasurements, and more similar to ambulatory daytime BP or home\nBP values. There is limited information on the prognostic value of\nunattended automated office BP measurements.4\n4.7.2.3 Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring\nABPM is the average of repeated automated measurements of BP\nduring the daytime, night-time, and over 24 h. ABPM is a better pre-\ndictor of hypertension-mediated organ damage (HMOD) and clinical\noutcomes than office BP, and identifies ‘white-coat’ hypertension and\nmasked hypertension (see below). Diagnostic thresholds for hyper-\ntension are lower with ABPM than office BP (Table 12).4\n4.7.2.4 Home blood pressure monitoring\nHome BP is the average of all BP readings performed with a validated\nsemiautomatic monitor, for at least 3 consecutive days (ideally 6 - 7\ndays), with readings in the morning and evening, taken seated in a\nquiet room after 5 min of rest. Home BP monitoring (HBPM) thresh-\nolds for the diagnosis of hypertension are lower than those for office\nBP (Table 12). Patient self-monitoring may have a beneficial effect on\nmedication adherence and BP control.4\nClinical indications for ambulatory or home monitoring are shown\nin Table 15.\n4.7.3 Screening and diagnosis of hypertension\nIdeally, all adults should be screened for the presence of hyperten-\nsion,578,579 but most countries lack the required resources and infra-\nstructure.

Also, carefully evaluate substance abuse (e.g.\ncocaine), drugs that may increase BP (e.g. cyclosporine, sympati-\ncomimetics), liquorice, etc. More detail on work-up of suspected\nsecondary hypertension is provided elsewhere.4\nEchocardiography is recommended in patients with ECG abnor-\nmalities, and should be considered when the result will influence clini-\ncal decision-making. Fundoscopy is recommended in grade 2 or 3\nhypertension and in all patients with DM. The routine measurement\nof other biomarkers and use of vascular imaging are not\nrecommended.548\u0002551\n4.7.5. Treatment of hypertension\nThe treatment of hypertension involves lifestyle interventions for all\npatients and drug therapy for most patients.\n4.7.5.1 Lifestyle interventions to lower blood pressure and/or reduce car-\ndiovascular risk\nLifestyle interventions are indicated for all patients with high-normal\nBP or hypertension because they can delay the need for drug treat-\nment or complement the BP-lowering effect of drug treatment.\nMoreover, most lifestyle interventions have health benefits beyond\ntheir effect on BP. Lifestyle is discussed extensively in section 4.3.\n4.7.5.2 Initiation of drug treatment\nDrug treatment decisions in CVD prevention are mostly based on\nabsolute CVD risk, risk modifiers, comorbidities, estimated benefit of\ntreatment, frailty, and patient preferences. The same is true for\nhypertension. Drug treatment of grade 1 hypertension (SBP\n140 - 159 mmHg) has level A evidence for reducing CVD risk. In\nyounger patients, however, the absolute 10-year CVD risk is often\nlow, and lifetime benefit of treatment should be considered and com-\nmunicated before instituting treatment (Figure 6 and section 3.2.3.6).\nIn many such cases, the absolute lifetime benefit per 10-mmHg\nreduction in SBP is at least moderate to high [Figure 15 (lifetime bene-\nfit calibrated in low-to-moderate CVD risk countries]. Also, the pres-\nence of HMOD mandates treatment of grade 1 hypertension. For\ngrade 2 hypertension or higher (SBP >160 mmHg), treatment is rec-\nommended, because not only is the lifetime benefit of reducing BP\nalmost universally high in such patients, there is also the importance\nof reducing the risk of HMOD resulting in other morbidities such as\nrenal disease, haemorrhagic cerebrovascular disease, and HF.\n4.7.5.3 Blood pressure treatment targets\nWhen drug treatment is used, the aim is to control BP to target\nwithin 3 months. Evidence now suggests that the BP targets in the\nprevious iteration of this guideline2 were too conservative, especially\nfor older patients. In line with the stepwise approach (section 3.2.3.1),\nit is now recommended that the first step in all treated patients\nshould achieve a treated SBP <140 mmHg and diastolic BP (DBP)\n<80 mmHg.552,554 The recommended ultimate SBP treatment target\nrange for younger patients (18\u000269 years) is 120\u0002130 mmHg,\nalthough some patients may safely achieve lower treated SBP levels\nthan this and, if they are well tolerated, there is no need to back-\ntitrate treatment.552,554\u0002556 The ultimate target SBP for patients aged\n>_70 years is <140 mmHg and down to 130 mmHg if toler-\nated.552,554,557,580 This change in the BP target range for older people\ncompared with the 2016 ESC prevention guidelines2 is supported by\nevidence that these treatment targets are safely achieved in many\nolder patients and are associated with significant reductions in the\nrisk of major stroke, HF, and CV death.557,580 It also takes into\naccount that the even lower SBP in the intensively treated group in\nSPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) (mean 124\nmmHg) probably reflects a conventional office SBP range of\n130\u0002139 mmHg.555 It is recognized, however, that the evidence sup-\nporting more strict targets is less strong for very old people (>80\nyears) and those who are frail. Also, in these older and especially frail\nTable 16\nRoutine tests for patients with hypertension\nRoutine tests\nHaemoglobin and/or haematocrit\nFasting blood glucose and/or HbA1c\nBlood lipids: total cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C, triglycerides\nBlood potassium and sodium\nBlood uric acid\nBlood creatinine and eGFR\nBlood liver function tests\nUrine analysis: microscopic; urinary protein by dipstick or, ideally, ACR\n12-lead ECG\nACR = albumin-to-creatinine ratio; ECG = electrocardiogram; eGFR = estimated\nglomerular ﬁltration rate; HbA1c = glycated haemoglobin; HDL-C = high-density\nlipoprotein cholesterol; LDL-C = low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.\nTable 17\nPatient characteristics that should raise the\nsuspicion of secondary hypertension.\nCharacteristics\nYounger patients (<40 years) with grade 2 hypertension or onset of any\ngrade of hypertension in childhood\nAcute worsening of hypertension in patients with previously documented\nchronically stable normotension\nResistant hypertension (BP uncontrolled despite treatment with optimal\nor best-tolerated doses of three or more drugs including a diuretic, and\nconﬁrmed by ABPM or HBPM)\nSevere (grade 3) hypertension or a hypertension emergency\nPresence of extensive HMOD\nClinical or biochemical features suggestive of endocrine causes of hyper-\ntension or CKD\nClinical features suggestive of OSA\nSymptoms suggestive of pheochromocytoma or family history of\npheochromocytoma\nABPM = ambulatory blood pressure monitoring; BP = blood pressure; CKD =\nchronic kidney disease; HBPM = home blood pressure monitoring; HMOD =\nhypertension-mediated organ damage; OSA = obstructive sleep apnoea.\nAdapted from 4\nESC 2021\n........................................................................\nESC 2021\nESC Guidelines\n3285\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/34/3227/6358713 by guest on 14 January 2026",

Lifestyle is discussed extensively in section 4.3.\n4.7.5.2 Initiation of drug treatment\nDrug treatment decisions in CVD prevention are mostly based on\nabsolute CVD risk, risk modifiers, comorbidities, estimated benefit of\ntreatment, frailty, and patient preferences. The same is true for\nhypertension. Drug treatment of grade 1 hypertension (SBP\n140 - 159 mmHg) has level A evidence for reducing CVD risk. In\nyounger patients, however, the absolute 10-year CVD risk is often\nlow, and lifetime benefit of treatment should be considered and com-\nmunicated before instituting treatment (Figure 6 and section 3.2.3.6).\nIn many such cases, the absolute lifetime benefit per 10-mmHg\nreduction in SBP is at least moderate to high [Figure 15 (lifetime bene-\nfit calibrated in low-to-moderate CVD risk countries]. Also, the pres-\nence of HMOD mandates treatment of grade 1 hypertension. For\ngrade 2 hypertension or higher (SBP >160 mmHg), treatment is rec-\nommended, because not only is the lifetime benefit of reducing BP\nalmost universally high in such patients, there is also the importance\nof reducing the risk of HMOD resulting in other morbidities such as\nrenal disease, haemorrhagic cerebrovascular disease, and HF.\n4.7.5.3 Blood pressure treatment targets\nWhen drug treatment is used, the aim is to control BP to target\nwithin 3 months. Evidence now suggests that the BP targets in the\nprevious iteration of this guideline2 were too conservative, especially\nfor older patients. In line with the stepwise approach (section 3.2.3.1),\nit is now recommended that the first step in all treated patients\nshould achieve a treated SBP <140 mmHg and diastolic BP (DBP)\n<80 mmHg.552,554 The recommended ultimate SBP treatment target\nrange for younger patients (18\u000269 years) is 120\u0002130 mmHg,\nalthough some patients may safely achieve lower treated SBP levels\nthan this and, if they are well tolerated, there is no need to back-\ntitrate treatment.552,554\u0002556 The ultimate target SBP for patients aged\n>_70 years is <140 mmHg and down to 130 mmHg if toler-\nated.552,554,557,580 This change in the BP target range for older people\ncompared with the 2016 ESC prevention guidelines2 is supported by\nevidence that these treatment targets are safely achieved in many\nolder patients and are associated with significant reductions in the\nrisk of major stroke, HF, and CV death.557,580 It also takes into\naccount that the even lower SBP in the intensively treated group in\nSPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) (mean 124\nmmHg) probably reflects a conventional office SBP range of\n130\u0002139 mmHg.555 It is recognized, however, that the evidence sup-\nporting more strict targets is less strong for very old people (>80\nyears) and those who are frail.

The lifetime benefit is expressed as ‘years of median life expectancy free from myocardial infarction or stroke’ gained from 10 mmHg SBP lowering.\nThe lifetime benefit is calculated by estimating lifetime CVD risk with the LIFE-CVD model multiplied by the HR (0.80) from a meta-analysis of the effect of\nBP lowering.

A treated office SBP of 130 mmHg likely corresponds to a 24-h\nSBP of 125 mmHg and home SBP <130 mmHg.4\n4.7.5.4 Drug treatment of hypertension\nThe most important driver of benefit is the magnitude of BP lowering.\nSingle-drug therapy will rarely achieve optimal BP control.\nInitial therapy with a combination of two drugs should be\nconsidered usual care for hypertension.560\u0002563,565,581 The only\nexceptions would be patients with a baseline BP close to the recom-\nmended target, who might achieve that target with a single drug, or\nvery old (>80 years) or frail patients who may better tolerate a more\ngentle reduction of BP. Initial combination therapy, even low-dose\ncombination therapy, is more effective at lowering BP than mono-\ntherapy,560,561,565 and will reduce BP faster and reduce heterogeneity\nin response.560,565 Moreover, initial combination therapy does not\nincrease risk of adverse effects.560\u0002563,565 Initiating therapy with two\ndrugs will also help overcome treatment inertia where patients\nremain on one drug long term despite inadequate BP control.562\nSingle-pill strategy to treat hypertension: poor adherence to\nBP-lowering medication is a major cause of poor BP control rates,\nand is directly related to the number of pills.581 Single-pill combina-\ntion therapy (if available) is the preferred strategy. This strategy will\ncontrol BP in most patients.560\u0002565\nRecommended drug therapy and treatment algorithm: five\nmajor classes of BP-lowering drug therapy have shown benefit in\nreducing CV events; angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors,\nangiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), beta-blockers, calcium chan-\nnel blockers (CCBs), and thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics.582 A rec-\nommended treatment algorithm based on best available evidence,\npragmatic considerations (e.g. combination pill availability), and path-\nophysiological reasoning is shown in Figure 16.4 A combination of an\nACE inhibitor or ARB with a CCB or thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic is\nthe preferred initial therapy for most patients with hyper-\ntension.566\u0002569 For those in whom treatment requires escalation to\nthree drugs, a combination of an ACE inhibitor or ARB with a CCB\nand a thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic should be used.563,570,571 Beta-\nblockers should be used when there is a specific indication (e.g.\nangina, post myocardial infarction, arrythmia, HFrEF, or as an alterna-\ntive to an ACE inhibitor or ARB in women of child-bearing poten-\ntial).582 Combinations of an ACE inhibitor and an ARB are not\nrecommended because of no added benefit on outcomes and\nincreased risk of harm.575,576\nSpecific modifications to the treatment algorithm are recom-\nmended for patients with CHD, CKD, HF, and AF.4\n4.7.6. Resistant hypertension\nResistant hypertension is defined as BP being uncontrolled despite\ntreatment with optimal or best-tolerated doses of three or more\ndrugs including a diuretic, and confirmed by ABPM or HBPM. The\nprevalence of resistant hypertension is likely to be <10% of treated\nhypertensive patients. Spironolactone is the most effective drug for\nlowering BP in resistant hypertension when added to existing treat-\nment; however, the risk of hyperkalaemia is increased in patients with\nCKD and eGFR <45 mL/min/m2 and blood potassium levels >4.5\nmmol/L.555,572 Potassium-binding drugs reduce the risk of hyperka-\nlaemia.573 When spironolactone is not tolerated, amiloride, alpha-\nblockers, beta-blockers, or centrally acting drugs, such as clonidine,\nhave evidence supporting their use.555,572,574 Renal denervation and\ndevice-based therapy may be considered for specific cases, and are\ndiscussed in the 2018 ESC/ESH hypertension guidelines.4\n4.7.7. Management of hypertension in women\nThe diagnosis and treatment of hypertension in women is similar to\nthat in men, except for women of child-bearing potential or during\npregnancy, because of potential adverse effects of some drugs on the\nfoetus, especially in the first trimester. In addition, the effect of oral\ncontraceptive pills on the risk of developing or worsening hyperten-\nsion should be considered.4\n4.7.8. Duration of treatment and follow-up\nTreatment of hypertension is usually maintained indefinitely because\ncessation of treatment usually results in a return of BP to pretreat-\nment levels. In some patients with successful lifestyle changes, it may\nbe possible to gradually reduce the dose or number of drugs. After\nBP is stable and controlled, visits should be scheduled at least annu-\nally, and include the control of other risk factors, renal function, and\nHMOD, as well as reinforce lifestyle advice. When there is a loss of\nBP control in a previously well-controlled patient, non-compliance\nwith therapy should be considered. Self-measurement of BP using\nHBPM helps engage the patient in their own management and can\nimprove BP control. HBPM is essential to monitor BP control in\npatients with a significant ‘white-coat effect’ or masked hypertension.\nSupervision of patient follow-up increasingly involves nurses and\npharmacists and is likely to become increasingly supported by tele-\nmedicine and app-based technologies.\n4.8.

Key risk factor concepts and newer paradigms\nExcept for glucose management, prevention of ASCVD follows the\nsame principles as for people without type 2 DM. Achieving BP and\nLDL-C targets is particularly important. More recently, trial evidence\nhas shown that drugs in the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2\n(SGLT2) inhibitor or glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-\n1RA) classes lower ASCVD, HF, and renal risks independently of\nbaseline HbA1c and whether patients are on metformin. Such bene-\nfits are most evident in those with existing ASCVD, HF, or CKD, but\nappear to extend to groups at elevated risk. This has led to newer\ntreatment algorithms.\n4.8.1.1 Lifestyle intervention\nLifestyle management is a first priority for ASCVD prevention and\nmanagement of DM. Most persons with DM are obese, so weight\ncontrol is crucial. Several dietary patterns can be adopted, where the\npredominance of fruits, vegetables, wholegrain cereals, and low-fat\nprotein sources is more important than the precise proportions of\ntotal energy provided by the major macronutrients. Salt intake should\nbe restricted. Specific recommendations include limiting saturated\nand trans fats and alcohol intake, monitoring carbohydrate consump-\ntion, and increasing dietary fibre. A Mediterranean-type diet, where\nfat sources are derived primarily from monounsaturated oils, is pro-\ntective against ASCVD. More detail is provided in section 4.3.2.\nA combination of aerobic and resistance exercise training is effec-\ntive in preventing the progression of type 2 DM and for the control\nof glycaemia. Smokers should be offered cessation support (see sec-\ntion 4.5). Lifestyle intervention lowers future microvascular and mac-\nrovascular risks as well as mortality in the longer term.603 Intensive\nlifestyle changes with low-calorie diets and mean weight losses in the\nregion of 10 kg leads to remission of type 2 DM in around 46% of\ncases at 1 year and 36% by 2 years.585 In those with prediabetes,\nother ASCVD risk factors should be assessed both before (to incen-\ntivize improvements) and after lifestyle changes have taken place.604\n4.8.1.2 Glycaemic control\nThe UKPDS587 established the importance of intensive glucose low-\nering with respect to CVD risk reduction in persons newly diagnosed\nwith DM, with better evidence to support metformin, which cor-\nrectly remains the first agent of choice for the majority of patients\ndiagnosed with DM. Three trials were conducted to see if CV events\ncould be reduced further with more intensive glycaemia treat-\nment.559,588,593 However, there were unexpected increases in total\nand ASCVD\ndeaths\nin\nthe ACCORD\n(Action\nto\nControl\nCardiovascular Risk in Diabetes) trial559 and a similar trend in VADT\n(Veterans Affairs Diabetes Trial).593 The results prompted concerns\nabout pursuing tight glucose control, particularly in older people with\nDM and in those with existing ASCVD. Subsequent meta-analyses of\nrelevant trials showed reductions in non-fatal AMI and CAD events,\nbut no effect on stroke or total mortality.605,606 The meta-analyses\nsuggested that CVD benefits for an average HbA1c reduction of 0.9%\nover 5 years were less than via treatment of cholesterol and BP.\nHbA1c targets should be personalized to individual characteristics\nand preferences.\nFour trials of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors607\u0002610 in patients\nwith DM and existing ASCVD or at high risk demonstrated non-\ninferiority (i.e. safety) but not superiority with respect to CVD risk.\nGlycaemia targets\nA target HbA1c for the reduction of CVD risk\nand microvascular complications of DM of\n<7.0% (53 mmol/mol) is recommended for the\nmajority of adults with either type 1 or type 2\nDM.587,588\nI\nA\nFor patients with a long duration of DM and in\nold or frail adults, a relaxing of the HbA1c tar-\ngets (i.e. less stringent) should be considered.588\nIIa\nB\nA target HbA1c of <_6.5% (48 mmol/mol) should\nbe considered at diagnosis or early in the course\nof type 2 DM in persons who are not frail and\ndo not have ASCVD.587,588\nIIa\nB\nTreatment of hyperglycaemia and ASCVD/cardiorenal risks\nMetformin is recommended as ﬁrst-line therapy,\nfollowing evaluation of renal function, in the\nmajority of patients without previous ASCVD,\nCKD, or HF.589\nI\nB\nIn persons with type 2 DM with ASCVD, metfor-\nmin should be considered, unless contraindica-\ntions are present.5,590\u0002592\nIIa\nB\nAvoidance of hypoglycaemia and excessive\nweight gain should be considered.559,588,593\nIIa\nB\nIn persons with type 2 DM and ASCVD, the use\nof a GLP-1RA or SGLT2 inhibitor with proven\noutcome beneﬁts is recommended to reduce\nCV and/or cardiorenal outcomes.590\u0002592\nI\nA\nIn patients with type 2 DM and TOD,c the use of\nan SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1RA with proven\noutcome beneﬁts may be considered to reduce\nfuture CV and total mortality.594\u0002597\nIIb\nB\nIn patients with type 2 DM and CKD, the use of\nan SGLT2 inhibitor is recommended to improve\nASCVD and/or cardiorenal outcomes.598,599\nI\nA\nIn patients with type 2 DM and HFrEF, use of an\nSGLT2 inhibitor with proven outcome beneﬁts\nis recommended to lessen HF hospitalizations\nand CV death.600,601\nI\nA\nIn patients with type 2 DM but without ASCVD,\nHF, or CKD, use of an SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-\n1RA should be considered based on estimated\nfuture risks (e.g. with the ADVANCE risk score\nor DIAL model) for adverse CVD or cardiorenal\noutcomes from risk factor proﬁles.602\nIIa\nB\nACR = albumin-to-creatinine ratio; ADVANCE = Action in Diabetes and\nVascular disease: preterAx and diamicroN-MR Controlled Evaluation; ASCVD =\natherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; CKD = chronic kidney disease; CV = car-\ndiovascular; DIAL = Diabetes lifetime-perspective prediction; DM = diabetes\nmellitus; eGFR = estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate; GLP-1RA = glucagon-like\npeptide-1 receptor agonist; HbA1c = glycated haemoglobin; HF = heart failure;\nHFrEF = heart failure with reduced ejection fraction; PA = physical activity;\nSGLT2 = sodium-glucose cotransporter 2; TOD = target organ damage.\naClass of recommendation.\nbLevel of evidence.\ncSee Table 4 for details.\nESC 2021\nESC Guidelines\n3289\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/34/3227/6358713 by guest on 14 January 2026",

However, a more recent trial in people with type 2 DM\nand ASCVD showed ertugliflozin to be non-inferior to placebo with\nrespect to MACE outcomes.614 Whether the results represent a\nclass effect is, therefore, not clear. Four further SGLT2 inhibitor trials\ndemonstrated the benefit of canagliflozin598 and dapagliflozin599 in\npatients with CKD [with DAPA-CKD (Dapagliflozin and Prevention\nof Adverse Outcomes in Chronic Kidney Disease) showing similar\nbenefits in people without DM], and dapagliflozin600 and empagliflo-\nzin601 in patients with HFrEF, with both trials showing similar benefits\nin those without type 2 DM.\nThe specific pattern of trial results (e.g. early separation of curves\nfor HF hospitalization) suggests that the benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors\nmay relate more to cardiorenal haemodynamic effects than to athe-\nrosclerosis.600 Other than genitourinary infections, rates of adverse\nevents (including diabetic ketoacidosis) were generally low. One trial\nshowed an excess of amputations and fractures,612 but none of the\nother trials noted imbalances. Patients should be advised on the\nimportance of genitourinary hygiene before being prescribed these\nmedications.\nGLP-1RAs reduce MACE, CV death, and all-cause mortality by\naround 12%, with around a 9% reduction in myocardial infarction and\na 16% reduction in stroke.591 Furthermore, HF is lowered by 9% and\na composite renal outcome was lowered by 17%. The results cannot\nbe explained by lowering of glucose levels and, in multiple SGLT2\ninhibitor and GLP-1RA trials, subgroup analyses suggested that these\nbenefits could be independent of metformin use.594\u0002597 Most trials\nwere conducted in patients with existing ASCVD or, in the REWIND\n(Researching Cardiovascular Events With a Weekly Incretin in\nDiabetes) trial, with a significant proportion of patients at high risk for\nCVD.615 Side-effects of this class mainly include nausea and vomiting,\nwhich can lessen with gradual up-titration. Risks of hypoglycaemia\ncan be reduced by lowering doses of sulphonylureas or insulin.\nThe largely positive results of these two classes of drugs (SGLT2\ninhibitors and GLP-1RAs) have led to rapid changes in DM algo-\nrithms, but with some differences in interpretation.602 Most DM\nguidelines, including those within the 2020 American Diabetes\nAssociation (ADA)/European Association for the Study of Diabetes\n(EASD) consensus report,592 recommend that metformin should be\nused as first-line treatment, while the ESC Guidelines5 recommended\nin 2019 that SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1RAs may be used without\nmetformin in people with DM and CVD or at high risk of CVD, as\nreviewed.602 A subset of the writing groups of the ADA/EASD con-\nsensus report and the ESC Guidelines616 was convened as an expert\npanel. The expert panel emphasized the overall commonalities of\napproach and the need to ensure that people with type 2 DM, CVD,\nHF, or CKD are treated appropriately with an SGLT2 inhibitor or\nGLP-1RA. The panel concluded that this approach should be initiated\nindependent of background therapy, glycaemic control, or individual-\nized treatment goals.616 The view of the ESC is that metformin\nshould be considered, but is not mandatory first-line treatment in\npatients with ASCVD or evidence of TOD. Certainly, the initiation of\nmetformin in such patients should not forego or delay the initiation\nof evidence-based SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP-1RAs. A risk score plus\ncost-effective analyses would be useful to determine which patients\nfree from ASCVD or evidence of TOD may be recommended for\nthese newer drugs. In all the above, there is no evidence of any sex\ninteraction in benefits. Finally, people with type 2 DM should be\ninvolved in decision-making after explanation of the potential benefits\nand side-effects of the drugs.\n4.8.2. Type 1 diabetes mellitus\nThe DCCT (Diabetes Control and Complications Trial) established\nthe importance of tight glucose control to lessen the risks of both\nmicrovascular and macrovascular disease in both men and women\nwith type 1 DM.617 A 27-year follow-up of this trial showed that 6.5\nyears of intensive DM therapy was associated with a modestly lower\nall-cause mortality rate.617 A glycaemic target for HbA1c of\n6.5\u00027.5% (48\u000258 mmol/mol) appears to be a balanced approach\nfor long-term care.\nRecently, metformin was shown not to lower progression of caro-\ntid IMT in persons with type 1 DM considered to be at elevated CVD\nrisk.618 Its use is not recommended in type 1 DM for this indication.\nSGLT2 inhibitors improve metabolic control in type 1 DM and may\ncomplement insulin therapy in selected patients.\n4.9.

Antithrombotic therapy in individuals without\natherosclerotic disease\nIn 2009, a meta-analysis in patients with low CVD risk reported a\n12% reduction in ASCVD with aspirin but a significant increase in\nmajor bleeding.619 CVD risk reduction and bleeding risks were similar\nin men and women.631 More contemporary primary prevention trials\nreported no or little benefit in patients without ASCVD and a consis-\ntent increase in bleeding.624,626,627 An updated meta-analysis did not\nshow a reduction in all-cause or CV mortality with aspirin, but did\nshow a lower risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction (RR 0.82) and\nischaemic stroke (RR 0.87).628 Conversely, aspirin was associated\nwith a higher risk of major bleeding (RR 1.50), intracranial bleeding\n(RR 1.32), and major gastrointestinal bleeding (RR 1.52), with no dif-\nference in the risk of fatal bleeding (RR 1.09). Bleeding risks were par-\nticularly increased in older persons. Other recent meta-analyses\nfound very similar results.629,630 Overall, although aspirin should\nnot be given routinely to patients without established ASCVD, we\ncannot exclude that in some patients at high or very high CVD\nrisk, the benefits outweigh the risks.632,633 In patients with DM\nand no evident ASCVD, the ASCEND study reported a 12% risk\nreduction and a significant increase in major bleeding, but not in\nfatal or intracranial bleeding.624 A meta-analysis of aspirin for\nprimary prevention in DM found a number needed to treat of\n95 to prevent one major adverse ischaemic event in 5 years.625\nHence, as in patients without DM, aspirin may be considered if\nCVD risk is exceptionally high. Only one in four patients in the\nASCEND study were being treated with a proton pump inhibitor.\nWider use than this could potentially amplify the benefit of aspirin\nin primary prevention for patients at higher atherosclerotic risk.\nIn apparently healthy persons <70 years of age with (very) high\nCVD risk, further studies are needed. Until then, decisions in these\nhigh-risk persons should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking both\nischaemic risk and bleeding risk into consideration.\n4.9.2. Antithrombotic therapy in individuals with\nestablished atherosclerotic disease\nIn established atherosclerotic disease, aspirin is associated with signifi-\ncant reductions in serious vascular events, including stroke and coro-\nnary events, and a 10% reduction in total mortality.619 These benefits\noutweigh the bleeding hazards.\nIn patients with previous myocardial infarction, stroke, or\nLEAD, clopidogrel showed a slight superiority for ischaemic\nevents with respect to aspirin, with a similar safety profile.620\nSubgroup analysis suggested a greater benefit of clopidogrel in\npatients with LEAD. A meta-analysis showed a clinically modest\nrisk reduction with P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy (number needed\nto treat: 244), and no effect on all-cause or vascular mortality and\nmajor bleeding.621 More guidance on antithrombotic treatment in\nthe specific settings of CAD, cerebrovascular disease, and LEAD,\nincluding possible indications for dual pathway inhibition in\npatients with LEAD, is given in section 6.\n4.9.3. Proton pump inhibitors\nProton pump inhibitors reduce the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding in\npatients treated with antiplatelet drugs and may be a useful adjunctive\ntherapy to improve safety.634,635 Proton pump inhibitors that specifi-\ncally inhibit CYP2C19 (omeprazole or esomeprazole) may reduce\nthe pharmacodynamic response to clopidogrel. Although this interac-\ntion has not been shown to affect the risk of ischaemic events, coad-\nministration of omeprazole or esomeprazole with clopidogrel is not\nrecommended.622\n4.10. Anti-inflammatory therapy\nAcknowledging that the process of atherosclerosis has inflamma-\ntory components has led to the investigation of various anti-\ninflammatory therapies in recent years. The first study to examine\nthe effects of reducing inflammation without impacting lipid levels\nwas CANTOS (Canakinumab Antiinflammatory Thrombosis\nOutcome Study), in which the monoclonal antibody, canakinu-\nmab, provided proof-of-concept for anti-inflammatory therapy in\nhigh-risk patients.636 This particular drug was, however, not fur-\nther developed for this indication because of the risk of fatal infec-\ntions and high costs. Methotrexate was the second anti-\ninflammatory drug studied for this purpose, but was not proven\neffective in reducing CVD outcomes.637\nIn 2019, COLCOT (Colchicine Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial)\nreported a significant reduction (HR 0.77) in CVD outcomes with\nlow-dose colchicine [0.5 mg o.d. (once a day)] in patients with a\nrecent AMI. The more recent LoDoCo2 (second low-dose colchi-\ncine) trial reinforced these results in patients with chronic CAD (HR\n0.69).85 This study observed a trend towards increased non-CV mor-\ntality, which requires further attention.\nThe use of colchicine in daily practice remains to be established\nbased on further clinical study data and experiences in daily practice.\nNonetheless, the encouraging results justify consideration of low-\ndose colchicine in selected, high-risk patients.\nRecommendation for anti-inﬂammatory therapy\nRecommendation\nClassa\nLevelb\nLow-dose colchicine (0.5 mg o.d.) may be consid-\nered in secondary prevention of CVD, particu-\nlarly if other risk factors are insufﬁciently\ncontrolled or if recurrent CVD events occur\nunder optimal therapy.85,86\nIIb\nA\nCVD = cardiovascular; o.d. = omni die (once a day).\naClass of recommendation.\nbLevel of evidence.\nESC 2021\n............................................................................................................\nIn patients with DM at high or very high CVD\nrisk, low-dose aspirin may be considered for pri-\nmary prevention in the absence of clear\ncontraindications.5,624,625\nIIb\nA\nAntiplatelet therapy is not recommended in indi-\nviduals with low/moderate CV risk due to the\nincreased risk of major bleeding.624,626\u0002630\nIII\nA\nASCVD = atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; CV = cardiovascular; DM = dia-\nbetes mellitus.\naClass of recommendation.\nbLevel of evidence.\nESC 2021\nESC Guidelines\n3291\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/34/3227/6358713 by guest on 14 January 2026",

Antithrombotic therapy in individuals without\natherosclerotic disease\nIn 2009, a meta-analysis in patients with low CVD risk reported a\n12% reduction in ASCVD with aspirin but a significant increase in\nmajor bleeding.619 CVD risk reduction and bleeding risks were similar\nin men and women.631 More contemporary primary prevention trials\nreported no or little benefit in patients without ASCVD and a consis-\ntent increase in bleeding.624,626,627 An updated meta-analysis did not\nshow a reduction in all-cause or CV mortality with aspirin, but did\nshow a lower risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction (RR 0.82) and\nischaemic stroke (RR 0.87).628 Conversely, aspirin was associated\nwith a higher risk of major bleeding (RR 1.50), intracranial bleeding\n(RR 1.32), and major gastrointestinal bleeding (RR 1.52), with no dif-\nference in the risk of fatal bleeding (RR 1.09). Bleeding risks were par-\nticularly increased in older persons. Other recent meta-analyses\nfound very similar results.629,630 Overall, although aspirin should\nnot be given routinely to patients without established ASCVD, we\ncannot exclude that in some patients at high or very high CVD\nrisk, the benefits outweigh the risks.632,633 In patients with DM\nand no evident ASCVD, the ASCEND study reported a 12% risk\nreduction and a significant increase in major bleeding, but not in\nfatal or intracranial bleeding.624 A meta-analysis of aspirin for\nprimary prevention in DM found a number needed to treat of\n95 to prevent one major adverse ischaemic event in 5 years.625\nHence, as in patients without DM, aspirin may be considered if\nCVD risk is exceptionally high.

A meta-analysis showed a clinically modest\nrisk reduction with P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy (number needed\nto treat: 244), and no effect on all-cause or vascular mortality and\nmajor bleeding.621 More guidance on antithrombotic treatment in\nthe specific settings of CAD, cerebrovascular disease, and LEAD,\nincluding possible indications for dual pathway inhibition in\npatients with LEAD, is given in section 6.\n4.9.3. Proton pump inhibitors\nProton pump inhibitors reduce the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding in\npatients treated with antiplatelet drugs and may be a useful adjunctive\ntherapy to improve safety.634,635 Proton pump inhibitors that specifi-\ncally inhibit CYP2C19 (omeprazole or esomeprazole) may reduce\nthe pharmacodynamic response to clopidogrel.

Other recent meta-analyses\nfound very similar results.629,630 Overall, although aspirin should\nnot be given routinely to patients without established ASCVD, we\ncannot exclude that in some patients at high or very high CVD\nrisk, the benefits outweigh the risks.632,633 In patients with DM\nand no evident ASCVD, the ASCEND study reported a 12% risk\nreduction and a significant increase in major bleeding, but not in\nfatal or intracranial bleeding.624 A meta-analysis of aspirin for\nprimary prevention in DM found a number needed to treat of\n95 to prevent one major adverse ischaemic event in 5 years.625\nHence, as in patients without DM, aspirin may be considered if\nCVD risk is exceptionally high. Only one in four patients in the\nASCEND study were being treated with a proton pump inhibitor.\nWider use than this could potentially amplify the benefit of aspirin\nin primary prevention for patients at higher atherosclerotic risk.\nIn apparently healthy persons <70 years of age with (very) high\nCVD risk, further studies are needed. Until then, decisions in these\nhigh-risk persons should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking both\nischaemic risk and bleeding risk into consideration.\n4.9.2. Antithrombotic therapy in individuals with\nestablished atherosclerotic disease\nIn established atherosclerotic disease, aspirin is associated with signifi-\ncant reductions in serious vascular events, including stroke and coro-\nnary events, and a 10% reduction in total mortality.619 These benefits\noutweigh the bleeding hazards.\nIn patients with previous myocardial infarction, stroke, or\nLEAD, clopidogrel showed a slight superiority for ischaemic\nevents with respect to aspirin, with a similar safety profile.620\nSubgroup analysis suggested a greater benefit of clopidogrel in\npatients with LEAD. A meta-analysis showed a clinically modest\nrisk reduction with P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy (number needed\nto treat: 244), and no effect on all-cause or vascular mortality and\nmajor bleeding.621 More guidance on antithrombotic treatment in\nthe specific settings of CAD, cerebrovascular disease, and LEAD,\nincluding possible indications for dual pathway inhibition in\npatients with LEAD, is given in section 6.\n4.9.3. Proton pump inhibitors\nProton pump inhibitors reduce the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding in\npatients treated with antiplatelet drugs and may be a useful adjunctive\ntherapy to improve safety.634,635 Proton pump inhibitors that specifi-\ncally inhibit CYP2C19 (omeprazole or esomeprazole) may reduce\nthe pharmacodynamic response to clopidogrel. Although this interac-\ntion has not been shown to affect the risk of ischaemic events, coad-\nministration of omeprazole or esomeprazole with clopidogrel is not\nrecommended.622\n4.10. Anti-inflammatory therapy\nAcknowledging that the process of atherosclerosis has inflamma-\ntory components has led to the investigation of various anti-\ninflammatory therapies in recent years. The first study to examine\nthe effects of reducing inflammation without impacting lipid levels\nwas CANTOS (Canakinumab Antiinflammatory Thrombosis\nOutcome Study), in which the monoclonal antibody, canakinu-\nmab, provided proof-of-concept for anti-inflammatory therapy in\nhigh-risk patients.636 This particular drug was, however, not fur-\nther developed for this indication because of the risk of fatal infec-\ntions and high costs. Methotrexate was the second anti-\ninflammatory drug studied for this purpose, but was not proven\neffective in reducing CVD outcomes.637\nIn 2019, COLCOT (Colchicine Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial)\nreported a significant reduction (HR 0.77) in CVD outcomes with\nlow-dose colchicine [0.5 mg o.d. (once a day)] in patients with a\nrecent AMI. The more recent LoDoCo2 (second low-dose colchi-\ncine) trial reinforced these results in patients with chronic CAD (HR\n0.69).85 This study observed a trend towards increased non-CV mor-\ntality, which requires further attention.\nThe use of colchicine in daily practice remains to be established\nbased on further clinical study data and experiences in daily practice.\nNonetheless, the encouraging results justify consideration of low-\ndose colchicine in selected, high-risk patients.\nRecommendation for anti-inﬂammatory therapy\nRecommendation\nClassa\nLevelb\nLow-dose colchicine (0.5 mg o.d.) may be consid-\nered in secondary prevention of CVD, particu-\nlarly if other risk factors are insufﬁciently\ncontrolled or if recurrent CVD events occur\nunder optimal therapy.85,86\nIIb\nA\nCVD = cardiovascular; o.d. = omni die (once a day).\naClass of recommendation.\nbLevel of evidence.\nESC 2021\n............................................................................................................\nIn patients with DM at high or very high CVD\nrisk, low-dose aspirin may be considered for pri-\nmary prevention in the absence of clear\ncontraindications.5,624,625\nIIb\nA\nAntiplatelet therapy is not recommended in indi-\nviduals with low/moderate CV risk due to the\nincreased risk of major bleeding.624,626\u0002630\nIII\nA\nASCVD = atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; CV = cardiovascular; DM = dia-\nbetes mellitus.\naClass of recommendation.\nbLevel of evidence.\nESC 2021\nESC Guidelines\n3291\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/34/3227/6358713 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n...........................................................................................................\n4.11.

Population-level approaches to the\nprevention of cardiovascular disease\nPopulation level approaches to CVD prevention centre around\nupstream measures requiring broad public-health interventions tar-\ngeting lifestyle and promoting monitoring of CVD. These measures\nare designed to address populations and are intended to shift the\npopulation attributable risk. This is based on a prevention paradox\ndescribed by Geoffrey Rose in 1981.665 The population attributable\nrisk depends on the RR and on the prevalence of a risk factor in the\ngeneral population. If the prevalence of a significant RR factor is low,\nthen the population attributable risk may be modest. Conversely, if a\nlow-impact RR factor is common, the population attributable risk\nmay be high. This prevention approach following the Geoffrey Rose\nparadigm665,666 states that small shifts in the risk of disease across a\nwhole population consistently lead to greater reductions in disease\nburden than does a large shift in high-risk individuals only.667,668 In\nother words, many people exposed to a small risk may generate\nmore disease than a few exposed to a conspicuous risk. This\npopulation-wide approach—as opposed to strategies targeting high-\nrisk individuals—has major advantages at the population level whilst\nsometimes having only a modest benefit at the individual level,\nbecause it addresses the CV health of a large number of individuals\nover the entire life course. It should be noted that high-risk and\npopulation-level prevention strategies are not mutually exclusive and\nmust therefore coexist.\nPrevalence of high-risk conditions and incidence rates of CVD vary\nacross countries. Many of their underlying causes are known, and\nthey are closely related to dietary habits, PA, smoking, alcohol,\nemployment, social deprivation, and the environment. The objective\nof population approaches to prevention of CVD is to control the\nunderlying determinants of CV health and, in this way, reduce popula-\ntion incidence rates. The population approach may bring numerous\nbenefits, such as narrowing the gap in health inequalities, preventing\nother conditions such as cancer, pulmonary diseases, and type 2 DM,\nand saving costs from the avoided CV events and early retirement\ndue to health problems.\nIndividual behaviour is enacted in an environment with hierarchical\nlevels, which encompass individual choice, family influence, cultural and\nethnic grouping, workplace, healthcare, and policy at the regional, state\nand global levels (e.g. EU policies and international trade agreements).\nThe aim of this section of the guidelines is to provide evidence-based\nsuggestions for the most effective interventions to reduce CVD risk at\nthe population level, improve CVD health, and promote healthy\nchoices at the community, regional, and global level. Health challenges\ncannot be solved by the healthcare systems alone and require political\nsupport. To advance this cause, the WHO has been organizing Global\nConferences on Health promotion since 1990.\n5.2. Specific risk factor interventions at\nthe population level\nPopulation-level interventions aim to alter the societal environment,\nmodify certain social determinants of health, and provide incentives\nto encourage changes in individual behaviour and exposure to risk fac-\ntors. Social determinants of health include socioeconomic status (edu-\ncation, occupation, and income), wealth inequalities, neighbourhood\nand urban design, and social networks, to name but a few. Healthcare\nprofessionals play an important role in advocating evidence-based\npopulation-level interventions. By modifying the general context, one\ncan induce healthy decisions as a default in entire populations (all age\ngroups and particularly vulnerable ones). The task for both national\nand local authorities is to create social environments that provide\nhealthier defaults, taking health literacy into account.669,670 The evi-\ndence presented here builds on recent comprehensive reviews and\nindividual studies, noting that it is rarely feasible to use an RCT to eval-\nuate population-level interventions (in contrast to individual-level\ninterventions).671,672 The importance of heart disease in women has\nbecome apparent and sex differences in CVD prevention have\nprompted sex-specific awareness campaigns with the aim of reducing\nsex disparities in research and clinical care. While interpreting this\nsection, it is important to recognize that there are often vested inter-\nests, which may influence policy decisions on health promotion.\nThe supplementary material for this section presents evidence for\npopulation-level strategies dealing with specific risk factor interven-\ntions for PA (section 5.2.1), diet (section 5.2.2), smoking and tobacco\nuse (section 5.2.3), and alcohol consumption (section 5.2.4). Lifestyle\nchanges at the population level take time, may be expensive, and\nneed to be sustained over time. Furthermore, the benefits may be\nslow to manifest; however, they persist over the long term and\nimprove health-related quality of life and well-being.\n5.2.1.

Environment, air pollution, and\nclimate change\nAir pollution contributes to mortality and morbidity. It specifically\nincreases the risk of respiratory and CV diseases, notably CAD, HF,\ncardiac arrhythmias and arrest, cerebrovascular disease, and venous\nthromboembolism.158,673,674 Loss of life-expectancy due to ambient\nair pollution has been estimated at 2.9 years, accounting for an esti-\nmated global excess mortality of 8.8 million/year.159 Plausible mecha-\nnisms by which air pollution is linked to CVD include promoting\natherosclerosis, inflammation, thrombosis, systemic vascular dysfunc-\ntion, myocardial fibrosis, epigenetic changes, and interactions with\ntraditional risk factors.158\nImportant sources of fine particles are road traffic, power plants,\nand industrial and residential heating using oil, coal, and wood. Main\ncomponents of outdoor air pollution include airborne PM (ranging in\nsize from coarse particles 2.5\u000210 mm, fine particles <2.5 mm (PM2.5),\nand ultrafine particles <0.1 mm in diameter) and gaseous pollutants\nsuch as ozone, nitrogen dioxide, volatile organic compounds, carbon\nmonoxide, and sulphur dioxide, produced primarily by fossil fuel\ncombustion.158,675 Up to one-third of Europeans living in urban areas\nESC Guidelines\n3293\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/34/3227/6358713 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n.......................................................................................\nare exposed to levels exceeding EU air-quality standards. The EU\nCommission released a policy package to be implemented by 2030,\nwith measures to reduce harmful emissions from traffic, energy\nplants, and agriculture.\nIndoor air pollution and exposure to noise must also be highlighted.\nHousehold air pollution, such as that produced from burning biomass,\naccounts for over 3 million deaths worldwide.38 It has been estimated\nby the WHO that 30% of the European population is exposed to\nnightly levels of noise exceeding 55 dB.161 These levels have been\nassociated with hypertension, arteriosclerosis, CAD, CV mortality,\nand stroke. It should be noted that mitigating efforts to reduce noise\nexposure have not, as yet, proven to have a beneficial health effect.161\nThe extent to which environmental exposures in soil and water\ncontribute to CVD has also been established.157 Interventions to\nreduce this pollution are required, including factory regulations and\ndrinking water controls.157\nPatient organizations and health professionals have an important\nrole in supporting education and policy initiatives. Information on\npatients’ behaviour during smog peaks is needed. Economic\nincentives, such as reduced taxes on electric and hybrid cars, can con-\ntribute to the improvement of air quality as well as incentives encour-\naging the use of public transport. Urban design promoting the\nconstruction of new houses and schools in areas remote from high-\nways and polluting industries needs to be urged.\n‘Clean air’ legislation aimed at promoting decreased particle emissions,\nand promotion of public transport should also be encouraged. The\nurgency of accepting what might appear as ‘comfort sacrifices’ for distant\nhealth benefits, and the transitory high costs of reorganizing entire sec-\ntions of industry, probably remain a major dilemma to the population-\nbased approach. An example of such legislation is the European Green\nDeal, by which the EU aims to be climate neutral by 2050.\n5.3.1.Climate change\nClimate change resulting from the increasing use of fossil fuels, as a\nmajor source of both air pollution and ‘greenhouse’ gases, is becoming\na major public health and environmental concern. Societal measures to\nreduce such fuels, and transfer towards renewable sources, are becom-\ning urgent to reduce air pollution and climate change.676 The impact of\ndiet, notably long-term non-sustainable meat-based food production\nchains, as well as the impact of sedentary lifestyles on climate-altering\nvariables, will also need to be addressed by policy makers.\n5.4. Implications for public health policy\nand advocacy at the governmental and\nnon-governmental level\nPlease see the supplementary material section 3.5.\n6. Risk management of disease-\nspecific cardiovascular disease\nThis section addresses CVD prevention in specific clinical contexts.\nA significant number of patients already have such comorbidities,\nwhich put them at additional risk. The general principles of lifestyle\nmodification and treatment of major risk factors are outlined in sec-\ntion 4. In this section, only disease-specific aspects are added.\n6.1.Coronary artery disease\nDisease-specific acute management of coronary syndromes is cov-\nered in detail in recent guidelines.677\u0002680\nAs for antithrombotic therapy, dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT)\nfor 12 months, preferably with prasugrel or ticagrelor, is the standard\nantithrombotic treatment after ACS.681\u0002683 There are conflicting\ndata as to whether prasugrel is preferable to ticagrelor.684,685 A 6-\nmonth duration of DAPT after ACS is generally too short,686 but\nmay be considered in selected patients at high bleeding risk.\nIn patients with chronic coronary syndromes (CCS) undergoing\nelective PCI, the standard duration of DAPT is 6 months, but short-\nening this to 1 - 3 months is an option when bleeding risk is very\nhigh.622 Clopidogrel is the P2Y12 inhibitor of choice, but prasugrel\nand ticagrelor may be considered after complex interventions.622\nProlonged DAPT (>12 months) following PCI for either ACS or\nCCS is an option for patients who tolerate DAPT well and have fea-\ntures of high ischaemic risk.687,688 In patients with stable CAD, dual-\npathway inhibition with low-dose rivaroxaban (2.5 mg b.i.d.) and\naspirin improved CV outcomes at the price of more major bleeding\nevents than aspirin alone.83\nBased on the above, and in line with the CCS Guidelines,622 adding\na second antithrombotic drug (P2Y12 inhibitor or low-dose rivaroxa-\nban) to aspirin for long-term secondary prevention should be consid-\nered for patients who are at high ischaemic risk and do not have a\nhigh risk of bleeding. It may also be considered in patients who are at\nmoderate ischaemic risk and without a high risk of bleeding, but the\nbenefits are lower.622 More details on antithrombotic treatment\noptions are found in the ESC Guidelines for CCS.622\nRecommendations for patients with coronary artery\ndisease\nRecommendations\nClassa\nLevelb\nAspirin 75 - 100 mg daily is recommended for\npatients with a previous myocardial infarction or\nrevascularization.619\nI\nA\nAspirin 75 - 100 mg daily may be considered in\npatients without a history of myocardial infarc-\ntion or revascularization, but with deﬁnitive evi-\ndence of CAD on imaging.622\nIIb\nC\nIn ACS, DAPT with a P2Y12 inhibitor in addition\nto aspirin is recommended for 12 months, unless\nthere are contraindications such as excessive\nrisk of bleeding.681\u0002683\nI\nA\nIn patients with CCS, clopidogrel 75 mg daily is\nrecommended, in addition to aspirin, for 6\nmonths following coronary stenting, irrespective\nof stent type, unless a shorter duration (1 - 3\nmonths) is indicated due to risk or occurrence\nof life-threatening bleeding.622\nI\nA\nAdding a second antithrombotic drug (a P2Y12\ninhibitor or low-dose rivaroxaban) to aspirin for\nlong-term secondary prevention should be con-\nsidered in patients with a high risk of ischaemic\nevents and without high bleeding\nrisk.83,622,687\u0002689\nIIa\nA\nContinued\n........................................................................................\n3294\nESC Guidelines\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/34/3227/6358713 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n....................................................................................\nThe management of dyslipidaemia and hypertension in patients\nwith CAD is discussed in sections 4.6 and 4.7, respectively.

Cerebrovascular diseases\nInterventions for cerebrovascular diseases depend on the type of\nevent, i.e. ischaemic or haemorrhagic.732,733 Ischaemic events are\nmainly caused by atherothrombosis, cardiac embolism, or small ves-\nsel disease.734 Other mechanisms (e.g. arterial dissection, patent fora-\nmen ovale, thrombophilia, inherited diseases) are relatively rare.\nIntracerebral haemorrhage is mostly caused by hypertensive angiop-\nathy and/or cerebral amyloid angiopathy.735 Bleeding can be precipi-\ntated by surges in BP values, use of anticoagulants, or diseases\nimpairing coagulation.733,735\nIn patients with ischaemic stroke or TIA, antithrombotics prevent\nfurther vascular events. Cardioembolic ischaemia, which occurs\nmainly in AF, requires anticoagulation (see sections 3.4.3 and\n6.6).736\u0002742 In non-cardioembolic mechanism, platelet inhibitors are\nrecommended.619,620,743\u0002753\nIn non-cardioembolic ischaemic stroke, aspirin is the most studied\nantithrombotic drug. Aspirin 75\u0002150 mg/day reduces the risk of\nrecurrent ischaemic stroke and\nserious vascular events.619,743\nClopidogrel shows slight superiority to aspirin.620 In patients with\nischaemic stroke or TIA and ipsilateral carotid stenosis, ticagrelor\nadded to aspirin compared to aspirin alone reduced the risk of stroke\nor death at 1 month, without an increase of severe bleeding.754 Adding\naspirin to clopidogrel was associated with a non-significant reduction in\nmajor vascular events and an increased long-term bleeding risk.747\u0002749\nHowever, in patients with minor ischaemic stroke or TIA, a short\ncourse of DAPT with aspirin and clopidogrel is beneficial.750,751\nSimilarly, ticagrelor and aspirin vs. aspirin alone reduces stroke or death\nat 30 days after mild-to-moderate ischaemic stroke or TIA not treated\nwith thrombolysis or thrombectomy. However, DAPT with ticagrelor\nand aspirin did not improve the incidence of disability and contributed\nto severe bleeding.755 DAPT with dipyridamole plus aspirin also\nshowed superiority over aspirin alone.744 In patients with ischaemic\nstroke, however, dipyridamole plus aspirin vs. clopidogrel alone\nshowed similar rates of recurrent stroke, including haemorrhagic\nstroke,745 but more major haemorrhagic events. In patients with non-\ncardioembolic ischaemic stroke, oral vitamin K antagonists are not\nsuperior to aspirin and carry a higher bleeding risk.752,753 In the absence\nof a definite cause of ischaemia and a presumed occult cardioembolic\nAn MRA is recommended for patients with\nHFrEF already treated with an ACE inhibitor (or\nan ARNI) and a beta-blocker, to reduce the risk\nof HF hospitalization and death.718,719\nI\nA\nSacubitril/valsartan is recommended as a\nreplacement for an ACE inhibitor to reduce the\nrisk of HF hospitalization and death in patients\nwith HFrEF.707,730\nI\nB\nAn ARB is recommended to reduce the risk of\nHF hospitalization or CV death in symptomatic\npatients with HFrEF who are unable to tolerate\nan ACE inhibitor and/or ARNI (patients should\nalso receive a beta-blocker and an MRA).706\nI\nB\nDapagliﬂozin or empagliﬂozin are recom-\nmended, in addition to optimal treatment of an\nACE inhibitor (or ARNI), a beta-blocker, and an\nMRA, for patients with HFrEF to reduce the risk\nof HF hospitalization and death.600,601,730\nI\nA\nVericiguat may be considered in patients with symp-\ntomatic HFrEF who have experienced HF worsen-\ning despite treatment with an ACE inhibitor (or an\nARNI), a beta-blocker, and an MRA, to reduce the\nrisk of HF hospitalization or CV death.722\nIIb\nB\nDiuretics are recommended in patients with\nHFrEF with signs and/or symptoms of congestion\nto reduce the risk of HF hospitalization.723,724\nI\nC\nIvabradine should be considered in symptomatic\npatients with LVEF <_35%, in sinus rhythm, and with\na resting heart rate >_70 bpm despite treatment\nwith an evidence-based dose of a beta-blocker (or\nmaximum tolerated dose below that), an ACE\ninhibitor (or an ARNI), and an MRA, to reduce the\nrisk of HF hospitalization or CV death.725\nIIa\nB\nIvabradine should be considered in symptomatic\npatients with LVEF <_35%, in sinus rhythm, and\nwith a resting heart rate >_70 b.p.m. who are\nunable to tolerate or have contraindications for\na beta-blocker to reduce the risk of HF hospital-\nization or CV death.

In\npatients with either ischaemic or haemorrhagic cerebrovascular\ndisease who have a BP of 140/90 mmHg or higher, lowering BP\nreduces the risk of recurrent stroke.758,759 Optimal BP targets\nin these patients are uncertain, as is the optimal drug regimen.760\nMost evidence is available for ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and diuretics.\nComorbidities may guide the choice of antihypertensive agent. In\npatients with recent lacunar stroke, the target SBP is <130 mmHg.761\nIn patients with stroke (ischaemic or haemorrhagic) or TIA with an\nLDL-C level of 100 - 190 mg/dL, atorvastatin 80 mg/day reduced the\noverall incidence of strokes and CV events.762 A recent trial sup-\nported an LDL-C target of <1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL).508\nEvidence of cerebrovascular lesions (e.g. white matter hyperinten-\nsities, lacunes, non-lacunar ischaemia) in the absence of any stroke\nhistory is a relatively common finding at neuroimaging, especially in\nolder patients. Silent cerebrovascular disease is a marker of increased\nrisk of stroke.763,764 Arterial hypertension, DM, and cigarette smok-\ning contribute to these lesions and should be attended to. There are\nno studies addressing the best treatment options for silent cerebral\nischaemia.765\n6.4.

Smoking cessation increases walking distance and lowers\namputation risk.2 In patients with DM, glycaemic control improves\nlimb outcomes.768 Statins provide modest improvements in walking\ndistance, and lower the risk of adverse limb events.769,770 Combining\na statin with ezetimibe771 or a PCSK9 inhibitor also has beneficial\neffects.772\nPlatelet inhibitors are used to prevent limb-related and general CV\nevents. The optimal antiplatelet strategy remains unclear.773 DAPT is\ncurrently recommended only after intervention (irrespective of the\nstent type) for at least 1 month.\nIn the COMPASS (Cardiovascular Outcomes for People Using\nAnticoagulation Strategies) trial, low-dose rivaroxaban added to aspirin\nin CVD patients with an ABI <0.90 reduced not only ASCVD events,\nbut also major adverse limb events, including amputation (HR 0.54),\nRecommendations for patients with cerebrovascular\ndisease\nRecommendations\nClassa\nLevelb\nIn patients with a cerebrovascular event,\nimprovement of lifestyle factors in addition to\nappropriate pharmacological management is\nrecommended.732,733,741\nI\nA\nIn patients with ischaemic stroke or TIA, preven-\ntion with antithrombotics is recommended;\nchoice of antithrombotic depends on the mecha-\nnism of event.

In\npatients with recent lacunar stroke, the target SBP is <130 mmHg.761\nIn patients with stroke (ischaemic or haemorrhagic) or TIA with an\nLDL-C level of 100 - 190 mg/dL, atorvastatin 80 mg/day reduced the\noverall incidence of strokes and CV events.762 A recent trial sup-\nported an LDL-C target of <1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL).508\nEvidence of cerebrovascular lesions (e.g. white matter hyperinten-\nsities, lacunes, non-lacunar ischaemia) in the absence of any stroke\nhistory is a relatively common finding at neuroimaging, especially in\nolder patients. Silent cerebrovascular disease is a marker of increased\nrisk of stroke.763,764 Arterial hypertension, DM, and cigarette smok-\ning contribute to these lesions and should be attended to. There are\nno studies addressing the best treatment options for silent cerebral\nischaemia.765\n6.4.

However, further studies are\nneeded. Optimal antithrombotic therapy is addressed in more detail in\nthe 2017 ESC/European Society for Vascular Surgery (ESVS)\nGuidelines.775 Importantly, in patients with isolated asymptomatic\nLEAD (e.g. low ABI), antiplatelet treatment is not recommended.775\nRecommendations for BP and lipid management are congruent to\nthe general recommendations outlined in sections 4.6 and 4.7.\nHypertension targets are based mainly on INVEST (INternational\nVErapamil-SR/Trandolapril STudy).776 An SBP below 110\u0002120 mmHg\nmay increase CV events in patients with LEAD.776 ACE inhibitors and\nARBs reduce CV events in patients with LEAD,575,777 and are pre-\nferred (as monotherapy or as part of a combination drug regimen).778\nBeta-blockers are not contraindicated in mild-to-moderate LEAD as\nthey do not affect walking capacity or adverse limb events,779 and sig-\nnificantly reduce coronary events.780 Nevertheless, beta-blockers\nshould be carefully considered in critical limb-threatening ischaemia.\n6.5. Chronic kidney disease\nSevere CKD is associated with a very high risk of CVD and is consid-\nered a CAD risk equivalent (see section 3.2). As GFR declines, non-\ntraditional risk factors emerge and non-atherosclerotic CVD event\nrisk increases.204 Trials often exclude patients with eGFR <30 mL/\nmin/1.73 m2. In patients on dialysis, coronary syndromes may present\natypically, and angina equivalents—such as shortness of breath or\nfatigue—are frequent.788 Standard CVD risk management is effective\nin patients on dialysis, but unique haemodialysis-specific syndromes\n(i.e. intradialytic hypotension and myocardial stunning) associated\nwith mortality complicate treatment and modify outcomes.\nRisk classification of patients with various degrees of CKD is sum-\nmarized in Table 4. Treatment with a statin or statin/ezetimibe combi-\nnation is recommended in CKD patients with sufficiently high CVD\nrisk, but not in those treated with kidney replacement therapy. This\nrecommendation is built on evidence from SHARP (Study of Heart\nand Renal Protection), which demonstrated a reduction of major\natherosclerotic events.525 Statins should be dosed according to a\nmoderate-intensity regimen based on limited experience and risks\nassociated with high-intensity regimens.543 Subgroup analysis of a\nrecent study with a PCSK9 inhibitor has shown that the benefits\nmay extend to those with earlier CKD stages (60\u000290 as well as\n30\u000260 mL/min/1.73 m2).789\nTreatment with an ACE inhibitor or an ARB is recommended in\npatients with DM, hypertension, and albuminuria. These medications\nshould be titrated to the maximum tolerated dose (Kidney Disease\nImproving Global Outcomes grading 1B).\nIndividualized HbA1c targets, ranging from 6.5% to <8.0% in\npatients with DM and non-dialysis-dependent CKD, are recom-\nmended in parallel. The role of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1RAs in\nCKD associated with DM is addressed in section 4.8. Dapagliflozin has\nshown promising reno- and cardioprotective effects,599 and more\nstudies investigating SGLT2 inhibitors in CKD patients without DM\nare ongoing.790\nOverall, the management of CAD in CKD patients must be\ninformed by the modification of its clinical presentation in CKD, as\nwell as comorbidity and risks of treatment side-effects. Treatment of\nestablished risk factors is often suboptimal in patients with CKD.\n6.6. Atrial fibrillation\nThe simple ‘Atrial fibrillation Better Care’ (ABC) holistic pathway\n(‘A’ = Anticoagulation/Avoid stroke; ‘B’ = Better symptom man-\nagement; ‘C’ = Cardiovascular and Comorbidity optimization)\nstreamlines integrated care of patients with AF.215 The ABC path-\nway lowers risk of all-cause death and the composite of stroke,\nmajor bleeding, CV death, or first hospitalization,791 and lowers\nrates of CV events792,793 and health-related costs.794\nThe ‘C’ component of the ABC pathway refers to identification\nand management of concomitant diseases, cardiometabolic risk\nfactors, and unhealthy lifestyle factors. Therapy of underlying con-\nditions improves rhythm control in persistent AF and HF.216 In\nobese patients, weight reduction prevents AF recurrences and\nsymptoms.795\u0002802 Given that hypertension precipitates AF, treat-\nment of hypertension is mandatory. Alcohol excess is a risk factor\nfor incident AF,803,804 and abstinence reduced AF recurrences in\nregular drinkers.798 Many studies have demonstrated beneficial\neffects of moderate exercise/PA.805\u0002807 The incidence of AF\nappears, however, to be increased in elite athletes, mainly related\nto endurance sports.808\u0002811 Patients should be encouraged to\npractise moderate-intensity exercise and remain physically active\nto prevent AF incidence or recurrence, but avoid excessive\nendurance exercise. CR is a universally recommended pro-\ngramme for patients with ACS and/or revascularization, and for\npatients with HF.639,640,655 The benefits of EBCR are more uncer-\ntain in patients with AF, but CR remains recommended in patients\nwith the aforementioned indications.812 Continuous PAP may\nimprove rhythm control and attenuate AF recurrences in OSA\npatients.813\u0002816 Intensive glycaemic control does not affect the\nrate of new-onset AF.817 Optimal glycaemic control during the 12\nmonths before AF ablation does, however, reduce AF recurrence\nafter ablation.818 All patients with HF and AF should receive\nguideline-adherent HF therapy.819\nRecommendations in patients with chronic kidney dis-\nease: best medical therapya\nRecommendations\nClassb\nLevelc\nTreatment with an ACE inhibitor or an ARB is\nrecommended in patients with DM, hyperten-\nsion, and albuminuria.

Low vision, back and neck problems, osteoarthritis, COPD,\ndepression, and cancer are the most common non-CV comorbidities\nin CVD patients.

A value-based approach should always be\ndiscussed and proposed when possible.820 The incremental benefit of\nmedication when added to an already complex regimen is often\nuncertain.828 Moreover, care for multimorbid CVD patients is often\nfragmented and given by multiple providers, complicating decision-\nmaking and adherence to recommended treatment.820\nMultimorbid CVD patients have been underrepresented in most\nclinical trials that underlie the guidelines.

Trials including patients with\nmultimorbidity and endpoints that matter to patients, pragmatic tri-\nals, and the use of registries and big data could help elucidate how to\noptimize\ntreatment\nand\ncare\nfor\npatients\nwith\nCVD\nand\nmultimorbidity.820\nThere is a plea for a paradigm shift from disease-focused to\npatient-centred care for multimorbid CVD patients, with a central\nplace for patients’ overarching goals of care.828 ‘What matters to\nyou?’ should be the central question, instead of ‘what is the matter?’.\nPatient-centred care should include assessment of patients’ prefer-\nences, interpretation of the evidence and its application to the spe-\ncific patient, consideration of overall prognosis, including life\nexpectancy, functional status, and quality of life, and clinical feasibility.\nAdherence to treatment, the occurrence of adverse drug events, the\neconomic burden, and the stress experienced by caregivers should\nbe taken into account when optimizing therapies and care plans\nwhere adherence to essential medication is emphasized and non-\nessential drugs are stopped.828 Furthermore, advanced care planning\nshould be initiated early. Multidisciplinary teams and close collabora-\ntion between primary care workers and specialists is needed. Finally,\nautomated decision support systems for multimorbidity and CVD\ncould help in aligning the relevant evidence and making adequate\ndecisions.829\n7. Key messages\nRisk factors and risk classification\n• The major risk factors for ASCVD are cholesterol, BP, cigarette\nsmoking, DM, and adiposity.\n• Risk factors are treated in a stepwise approach to reach the ulti-\nmate treatment goals in apparently healthy people, patients with\nestablished ASCVD, and patients with DM.\n• 10-year CVD risk is estimated in apparently healthy people aged\n40\u000269 years with SCORE2, and in people aged >_70 years with\nSCORE2-OP.\n• Age-specific 10-year CVD risk thresholds—together with con-\nsideration of risk modifiers, frailty, comorbidities, lifetime CVD\nrisk, treatment benefit, polypharmacy, and patient preferences—\nguide treatment decisions for lipid and BP treatment.\n• There are various options of communicating the (residual) CVD\nrisk, and this should be tailored to the individual patient.\nRecommendations for lifestyle interventions and man-\nagement of risk factors and concomitant diseases in\npatients with atrial ﬁbrillation215\nRecommendations\nClassa\nLevelb\nIdentiﬁcation and management of risk factors\nand concomitant diseases are recommended to\nbe an integral part of treatment.795\nI\nB\nModiﬁcation of unhealthy lifestyle and targeted\ntherapy of intercurrent conditions is recom-\nmended to reduce AF burden and symptom\nseverity.216,795\u0002802\nI\nB\nAttention to good BP control is recommended\nin AF patients with hypertension to reduce AF\nrecurrences and risk of stroke and\nbleeding.800,801\nI\nB\nIn obese patients with AF, weight loss together\nwith management of other risk factors should be\nconsidered to reduce AF incidence, AF progres-\nsion, AF recurrences, and symptoms.795\u0002797\nIIa\nB\nAdvice and management to avoid alcohol excess\nshould be considered for AF prevention and in\nAF patients considered for oral anticoagulant\ntherapy.798,803,804\nIIa\nB\nPA should be considered to help prevent AF\nincidence or recurrence, with the exception of\nexcessive endurance exercise, which may pro-\nmote AF.805\u0002812\nIIa\nC\nOptimal management of OSA may be consid-\nered to reduce AF incidence, AF progression, AF\nrecurrences, and symptoms.813\u0002816\nIIb\nC\nAF = atrial ﬁbrillation;

CV risk\nin patients with cancer depends on both the CV toxicity of treat-\nments and patient-related factors.\n• Signs or symptoms of cardiac dysfunction should be monitored\nbefore, periodically during, and after treatment.\n• Exercise should be strongly advised, in particular aerobic exer-\ncise, to prevent cardiotoxicity.\n• COPD is a major risk factor for CVD, especially ASCVD, stroke,\nand HF.\n• COPD patients are prone to arrhythmias (AF and ventricular\ntachycardia) and sudden cardiac death.\n• All COPD patients should be investigated for CVD.\n• Common COPD medications are usually safe in terms of CV\nadverse events.\n• Chronic inflammatory conditions increase CVD risk.\n• Infection with HIV is associated with an increased risk of LEAD\nand CAD.\n• There is an association between influenza and periodontitis\ninfections and ASCVD.\n• Migraine, particularly migraine with aura, is an independent risk\nfactor for stroke and ischaemic cardiac disease.\n• The risk of ischaemic stroke in subjects with migraine with aura\nis magnified by the use of combined hormonal contraceptives\nand cigarette smoking.\n• Non-restorative sleep and a sleep duration that varies signifi-\ncantly up or down from the optimum of 7 h are associated with\nincreased CV risk.\n• Mental disorders are common in the general population (12-\nmonth prevalence of 27%) and are associated with excess\nmortality.\n• The onset of CVD increases the risk of mental disorders by 2.2-\nfold, leading to a worse prognosis.\n• Some mental disorders—even symptoms of anxiety and depres-\nsion—are associated with the development of CVD and with a\nworse prognosis in those with existing CVD (CHD, arterial\nhypertension, AF, HF).\n• Excess mortality is mainly caused by behaviour-dependent risk\nfactors (e.g. smoking addiction) and an impaired capacity for self-\ncare (e.g. treatment adherence).\n• NAFLD is associated with other cardiometabolic risk factors.\n• Patients with NAFLD should be evaluated for other cardiometa-\nbolic risk factors.\n• Sex-specific conditions:\n• Preeclampsia and pregnancy-related hypertension are asso-\nciated with a higher risk of CVD.\n• Polycystic ovary syndrome confers a significant risk for\nfuture development of DM.\n• ED is associated with future CV events and mortality in\nmen.\n• CVD risk should be assessed in men with ED.\n• Asking about ED should be a standard procedure in routine\nCV risk assessment in men.\nRisk factors and interventions at the individual level\n• Regular PA is a mainstay of ASCVD prevention.\n• Aerobic PA in combination with resistance exercise and the\nreduction of sedentary time are recommended for all adults.\n• A healthy diet lowers the risk of CVD and other chronic\ndiseases.\n• A shift from a more animal- to plant-based food pattern may\nreduce CVD.\n• Achieving and maintaining a healthy weight through lifestyle\nchanges has favourable effects on risk factors (BP, lipids, glucose\nmetabolism) and lowers CVD risk.\n• When changes in diet and PA—as well as other conventional,\nnon-invasive interventions—are unsuccessful, bariatric surgery\nshould be considered for high-risk individuals.\n• Anti-obesity medications with protective ASCVD effects may\nalso be considered.\n• Patients with mental disorders have sharply increased lifestyle\nrisks that need recognition and treatment.\n• Mental healthcare improves stress symptoms and quality of life,\nreduces the risk of suicide, and may improve CV outcomes.\n• The treatment of ASCVD patients with mental disorders\nrequires interdisciplinary cooperation and communication.\n• Stopping smoking rapidly reduces CVD risk and is the most\ncost-effective strategy for ASCVD prevention.\n3300\nESC Guidelines\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/34/3227/6358713 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n.............................................................................................................................................................................\n• There is strong evidence for medication-assisted interventions:\nNRT, bupropion, varenicline, and drugs in combination. The\nmost effective are assistance using drug therapy and follow-up\nsupport.\n• Lower is better: the effect of LDL-C on the risk of CVD appears\nto be determined by both the baseline level and the total dura-\ntion of exposure to LDL-C.\n• Lowering LDL-C with statins, ezetimibe, and—if needed\nand cost-effective—PCSK9 inhibitors, decreases the risk of\nASCVD proportionally to the absolute achieved reduction in\nLDL-C.\n• When LDL-C goals according to level of risk cannot be attained,\naim to reduce LDL-C by >_50% and then strive to reduce other\nrisk factors as part of a shared decision-making process with the\npatient.\n• When hypertension is suspected, the diagnosis should be con-\nfirmed by repeated office BP measurement at different visits, or\nABPM or HBPM.\n• Lifestyle interventions are indicated for all patients with hyper-\ntension and can delay the need for drug treatment or comple-\nment the BP-lowering effect of drug treatment.\n• BP-lowering drug treatment is recommended in many adults\nwhen office BP is >_140/90 mmHg and in all adults when BP is\n>_160/100 mmHg.\n• BP treatment goals are lower than in the previous ESC CVD pre-\nvention guidelines for all patient groups, including independent\nolder patients.\n• Wider use of single-pill combination therapy is recommended to\nreduce poor adherence to BP treatment.\n• A simple drug treatment algorithm should be used to treat most\npatients, based on combinations of a renin\u0002angiotensin system\n(RAS) blocker with a CCB or thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic, or all\nthree. Beta-blockers may also be used where there is a\nguideline-directed indication.\n• Many patients with hypertension will be at sufficient risk to bene-\nfit from statin therapy for primary prevention. Antiplatelet ther-\napy is indicated for secondary prevention.\n• A multifactorial approach, including lifestyle changes, is critical in\npersons with type 2 DM.\n• Management of hyperglycaemia reduces the risk of microvascu-\nlar complications and, to a lesser extent, the risk of CVD.\nGlycaemic targets should be relaxed in older adults and frail\nindividuals.\n• New antihyperglycaemic drugs are particularly important for per-\nsons with type 2 DM with existing ASCVD and (heightened risk\nof) HF or renal disease, broadly irrespective of glycaemia levels.\nType 1 diabetes mellitus\n• Intensive management of hyperglycaemia in DM reduces the risk\nof micro- and macrovascular complications and premature mor-\ntality; a target of 6.5\u00027.5% (48\u000258 mmol/mol) HbA1c is\nrecommended.\n• Metformin is not recommended in type 1 DM to lower CVD\nrisk.\n• Dapagliflozin has been recommended for use in type 1 DM,\nalthough there is an increased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis with\nsuch therapies.\n• Targeting other risk factors, in particular smoking, BP, and cho-\nlesterol levels, remains an important means to lower CVD risk in\ntype 1 DM.\n• All patients with established ASCVD require some form of\nantithrombotic therapy.\n• Anti-inflammatory therapy is a promising strategy in CVD\nprevention.\n• Patients after ACS and/or coronary artery bypass graft/PCI, or\nwith chronic HFrEF, should participate as early as possible in\nstructured, multidisciplinary EBCR and prevention programmes.\n• EBCR and prevention programmes must comply with certain\nquality standards and be individualized to each patient’s profile.\n• Participation and long-term adherence to these programmes has\nto be encouraged and enhanced. Telerehabilitation and mHealth\nmay help towards achieving this target.\nPopulation-level\napproaches\nto\ncardiovascular\ndisease\nprevention\nPhysical activity\n• A significant percentage of the worldwide population, in particu-\nlar the European population, shows high levels of sedentary\nbehaviour and physical inactivity.\n• The percentage of those exercising at a regular level is greater in\nmen than in women.\n• Global progress to increase PA has been slow, largely due to\nlack of awareness and investment.\n• The optimal dose of different types of PA for CVD and general\nprevention is still controversial and subjected to frequent\nupdates. Increasing moderate-to-vigorous PA and reducing sit-\nting time, however, is beneficial and any level of PA is considered\nbetter than none.\n• PA for health promotion should be implemented by physicians\nin the same way as drug prescription and should also be pro-\nmoted by other healthcare professionals.\n• Population-based interventions are effective in promoting\nPA for groups based on age, sex, and race, for high-, middle-, and\nlow-income\npopulations,\nand\nfor\ndifferent\nenvironments\n(e.g. kindergarten, school, gyms, companies, and worksites in\ngeneral).\n• Daily PA at school should be practised for at least 3 h/week, and\npreferably for 60 minutes per day.\n• Population-based approaches are complementary to individual-\ncentred interventions.\n• Diet\n• Structural measures such as changes in agricultural supply chain\nand food industry, product reformulation, limitations on (digital)\nmarketing to children, taxes on unhealthy foods/nutrients, and\nconsumer-friendly nutrition labelling will improve healthy food\nchoices.\n• Healthy environments in the community, on public transport, at\nschools, and in workplaces will stimulate a healthier lifestyle.\n• The WHO Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control\nof Non-Communicable Diseases 2013\u00022020 extended to 2025\nrecommends to develop goals in global, regional, and national\nagendas.

Quality indicators\nQuality indicators (QIs) are tools that may be used to evaluate care\nquality, including that of processes of care and clinical outcomes.730\nThey may also serve as a mechanism for enhancing adherence to\nguideline recommendations, through quality assurance endeavours\nand benchmarking of care providers.831 As such, the role of QIs in\ndriving quality improvement is increasingly recognized and attracts\ninterest from healthcare authorities, professional organizations,\npayers, and the public.832\nThe ESC recognizes the need for measuring and reporting the\nquality and outcomes of CV care. One aspect of this is the develop-\nment and implementation of QIs for CVD. The methodology by\nwhich the ESC QIs are developed has been published832 and, to date,\na suite of QIs for an initial tranche of CV conditions has been pro-\nduced.833,834 To facilitate quality improvement initiatives, the disease-\nspecific ESC QIs are included in corresponding ESC Clinical Practice\nGuidelines.215,680 This is further enhanced by way of their integration\ninto the EORP (EURObservational Research Programme) and the\nEuroHeart (European Unified Registries On Heart Care Evaluation\nand Randomized Trials) project.835\nFor CVD prevention, QIs are available for specific conditions, such\nas the management of high BP836 and secondary lipid prevention.837\nHowever, a comprehensive set of QIs that encompasses the depth\nand breadth of CVD prevention is lacking. Such a set may evaluate\nthe adoption of, and adherence to, the guideline recommendations\nprovided in this document, and may be applied retrospectively to\nassess the delivery of evidence-based care. Thus, and in line with\nother ESC Clinical Practice Guidelines, the process of developing and\ndefining QIs for CVD prevention has been initiated during the writing\nof this guideline and the results will be published in a separate\ndocument.\n11 Supplementary data\nSupplementary data with additional Supplementary Figures, Tables,\nand text complementing the full text are available on the European\nHeart Journal website and via the ESC website at https://www.escar\ndio.org/guidelines.\n12.

Quality indicators\nQuality indicators (QIs) are tools that may be used to evaluate care\nquality, including that of processes of care and clinical outcomes.730\nThey may also serve as a mechanism for enhancing adherence to\nguideline recommendations, through quality assurance endeavours\nand benchmarking of care providers.831 As such, the role of QIs in\ndriving quality improvement is increasingly recognized and attracts\ninterest from healthcare authorities, professional organizations,\npayers, and the public.832\nThe ESC recognizes the need for measuring and reporting the\nquality and outcomes of CV care. One aspect of this is the develop-\nment and implementation of QIs for CVD. The methodology by\nwhich the ESC QIs are developed has been published832 and, to date,\na suite of QIs for an initial tranche of CV conditions has been pro-\nduced.833,834 To facilitate quality improvement initiatives, the disease-\nspecific ESC QIs are included in corresponding ESC Clinical Practice\nGuidelines.215,680 This is further enhanced by way of their integration\ninto the EORP (EURObservational Research Programme) and the\nEuroHeart (European Unified Registries On Heart Care Evaluation\nand Randomized Trials) project.835\nFor CVD prevention, QIs are available for specific conditions, such\nas the management of high BP836 and secondary lipid prevention.837\nHowever, a comprehensive set of QIs that encompasses the depth\nand breadth of CVD prevention is lacking. Such a set may evaluate\nthe adoption of, and adherence to, the guideline recommendations\nprovided in this document, and may be applied retrospectively to\nassess the delivery of evidence-based care. Thus, and in line with\nother ESC Clinical Practice Guidelines, the process of developing and\ndefining QIs for CVD prevention has been initiated during the writing\nof this guideline and the results will be published in a separate\ndocument.\n11 Supplementary data\nSupplementary data with additional Supplementary Figures, Tables,\nand text complementing the full text are available on the European\nHeart Journal website and via the ESC website at https://www.escar\ndio.org/guidelines.\n12.
