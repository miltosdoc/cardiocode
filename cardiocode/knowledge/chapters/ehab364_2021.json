Guidelines\nand their recommendations should facilitate decision-making of\nhealth professionals in their daily practice. However, the final deci-\nsions concerning an individual patient must be made by the responsi-\nble health professional(s) in consultation with the patient and\ncaregiver, as appropriate.\nA great number of guidelines have been issued in recent years by\nthe European Society of Cardiology (ESC), as well as by other soci-\neties and organizations. Because of their impact on clinical practice,\nquality criteria for the development of guidelines have been estab-\nlished in order to make all decisions transparent to the user. The rec-\nommendations for formulating and issuing ESC Guidelines can be\nfound on the ESC website (https://www.escardio.org/Guidelines).\nThe ESC Guidelines represent the official position of the ESC on a\ngiven topic and are regularly updated.\nIn addition to the publication of Clinical Practice Guidelines, the ESC\ncarries out the EurObservational Research Programme of international\nregistries of cardiovascular diseases and interventions which are essen-\ntial to assess diagnostic/therapeutic processes, use of resources, and\nadherence to guidelines. These registries aim at providing a better\nunderstanding of medical practice in Europe and around the world,\nbased on high-quality data collected during routine clinical practice.\nFurthermore, the ESC has developed and embedded in this docu-\nment a set of quality indicators (QIs), which are tools to evaluate the\nlevel of implementation of the guidelines and may be used by the\nESC, hospitals, healthcare providers, and professionals to measure\nclinical practice as well as in educational programmes, alongside the\nkey messages from the guidelines, to improve quality of care and clini-\ncal outcomes.\nThe Members of this Task Force were selected by the ESC, includ-\ning representation from its relevant ESC subspecialty groups, in order\nto represent professionals involved with the medical care of patients\nwith this pathology. Selected experts in the field undertook a com-\nprehensive review of the published evidence for management of a\ngiven condition according to ESC Clinical Practice Guidelines\nCommittee (CPG) policy. A critical evaluation of diagnostic and ther-\napeutic procedures was performed, including assessment of the\nrisk\u0002benefit ratio. The level of evidence and the strength of the rec-\nommendation of particular management options were weighed and\ngraded according to pre-defined scales, as outlined below.\nThe experts of the writing and reviewing panels provided declara-\ntion of interest forms for all relationships that might be perceived as\n6\nESC Guidelines\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/35/3427/6358547 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n....................................\nreal or potential sources of conflicts of interest. Their declarations of\ninterest were reviewed according to the ESC declaration of interest\nrules and can be found on the ESC website (http://www.escardio.org/\nguidelines) and have been compiled in a report and published in a\nsupplementary document simultaneously with the guidelines.\nThis process ensures transparency and prevents potential biases in\nthe development and review processes. Any changes in declarations\nof interest that arose during the writing period were notified to the\nESC and updated. The Task Force received its entire financial support\nfrom the ESC without any involvement from the healthcare industry.\nThe ESC CPG supervises and coordinates the preparation of\nnew guidelines. The Committee is also responsible for the\nendorsement process of these Guidelines. The ESC Guidelines\nundergo extensive review by the CPG and external experts. After\nappropriate revisions, the guidelines are signed-off by all the\nexperts involved in the Task Force. The finalized document is\nsigned-off by the CPG for publication in the European Heart\nJournal. The guidelines were developed after careful consideration\nof the scientific and medical knowledge and the evidence available\nat the time of their dating.\nThe task of developing ESC Guidelines also includes the creation\nof educational tools and implementation programmes for the recom-\nmendations including condensed pocket guideline versions, summary\nslides, summary cards for non-specialists, and an electronic version\nTable 1\nClasses of recommendations\n©ESC 2021\nClasses of recommendations\nClass I \nEvidence and/or general agreement \nthat a given treatment or procedure is \nIs recommended or is indicated\nWording to use\nClass III \nEvidence or general agreement that the \ngiven treatment or procedure is not \nuseful/effective, and in some cases \nmay be harmful.\nIs not recommended\n   Class IIb\nestablished by evidence/opinion.\nMay be considered\n   Class IIa\nWeight of evidence/opinion is in \nShould be considered\nClass II \nTable 2\nLevels of evidence\nLevel of \nevidence A\nData derived from multiple randomized clinical trials \nor meta-analyses. \nLevel of \nevidence B\nData derived from a single randomized clinical trial\nor large non-randomized studies. \nLevel of \nevidence C\nConsensus of opinion of the experts and/or small studies, \nretrospective studies, registries.\n©ESC 2021\nESC Guidelines\n7\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/35/3427/6358547 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n.........................................................................................\nfor digital applications (smartphones, etc.).

Implementation\nprogrammes are needed because it has been shown that the out-\ncome of disease may be favourably influenced by the thorough appli-\ncation of clinical recommendations.\nHealth professionals are encouraged to take the ESC Guidelines\nfully into account when exercising their clinical judgement, as well as\nin the determination and the implementation of preventive, diagnos-\ntic, or therapeutic medical strategies. However, the ESC Guidelines\ndo not override in any way whatsoever the individual responsibility\nof health professionals to make appropriate and accurate decisions in\nconsideration of each patient’s health condition and in consultation\nwith that patient or the patient’s caregiver where appropriate and/or\nnecessary. It is also the health professional’s responsibility to verify\nthe rules and regulations applicable in each country to drugs and devi-\nces at the time of prescription.\n2 Introduction\nPacing is an important part of electrophysiology and of cardiology in\ngeneral. Whereas some of the situations requiring pacing are clear and\nhave not changed over the years, many others have evolved and have\nbeen the subject of extensive recent research, such as pacing after syn-\ncope (section 5), pacing following transcatheter aortic valve implanta-\ntion (TAVI; section 8), cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) for\nheart failure (HF) and for prevention of pacing-induced cardiomyop-\nathy (section 6), and pacing in various infiltrative and inflammatory dis-\neases of the heart, as well as in different cardiomyopathies (section 8).\nOther novel topics include new diagnostic tools for decision-making\non pacing (section 4), as well as a whole new area of pacing the His bun-\ndle and the left bundle branch (section 7). In addition, attention has\nincreased in other areas, such as how to systematically minimize pro-\ncedural risk and avoid complications of cardiac pacing (section 9), how\nto manage patients with pacemakers in special situations, such as when\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or irradiation are needed (section\n11), how to follow patients with a pacemaker with emphasis on the\nuse of remote monitoring, and how to include shared decision-making\nin caring for this patient population (section 12).\nThe last pacing guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology\n(ESC) were published in 2013; therefore, a new set of guidelines was\nfelt to be timely and necessary.\nTo address these topics, a Task Force was established to create\nthe new guidelines. As well as receiving the input of leading experts in\nthe field of pacing, the Task Force was enhanced by representatives\nfrom the Association for Acute CardioVascular Care, the Heart\nFailure Association, the European Association of Cardiothoracic\nSurgery, the European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular\nInterventions, the ESC Working Group\non Myocardial and\nPericardial Diseases, as well as the Association of Cardiovascular\nNursing & Allied Professions.\n2.1 Evidence review\nThis document is divided into sections, each with a section coordina-\ntor and several authors. They were asked to thoroughly review the\nrecent literature on their topics, and to come up with recommenda-\ntions and grade them by classification as well as by level of evidence.\nWhere data seemed controversial, a methodologist (Dipak Kotecha)\nwas asked to evaluate the strength of the evidence and to assist in\ndetermining the class of recommendation and level of evidence. All\nrecommendations were voted on by all authors of the document and\nwere accepted only if supported by at least 75% of the co-authors.\nThe leaders (Jens Cosedis Nielsen and Michael Glikson) and the\ncoordinators of this document (Yoav Michowitz and Mads Brix\nKronborg) were responsible for alignment of the recommendations\nbetween sections, and several members of the writing committee\nwere responsible for overlap with other ESC Guidelines, such as the\nHF guidelines and the valvular heart disease guidelines.\n2.2 Relationships with industry\nAll work in this document was voluntary and all co-authors were\nrequired to declare and prove that they do not have conflicts of inter-\nests, as defined recently by the Scientific Guideline Committee of the\nESC and the ESC board.\n2.3 What is new in these guidelines\n2.3.1\nNew concepts and new sections\nTable 3\nNew concepts and sections in current\nguidelines\nConcept/section\nSection\nNew section on types and modes of pacing, including con-\nduction system pacing and leadless pacing\n3.4\nNew section on sex differences in pacing\n3.5\nNew section on evaluation of patients for pacing\n4\nExpanded and updated section on CRT\n6\nNew section on alternative pacing strategies and sites\n7\nExpanded and updated section on pacing in speciﬁc con-\nditions, including detailed new sections on post TAVI,\npostoperative and pacing in the presence of tricuspid\nvalve diseases, and operations\n8\nA new section on implantation and perioperative manage-\nment, including perioperative anticoagulation\n9\nAn expanded revised section on CIED complications\n10\nA new section on various management considerations,\nincluding MRI, radiotherapy, temporary pacing, periopera-\ntive management, sport activity, and follow up\n11\nA new section on patient-centred care\n12\nCIED = cardiovascular implantable electronic device; CRT = cardiac resynchroni-\nzation therapy; MRI = magnetic resonance imaging; TAVI = transcatheter aortic\nvalve implantation.\nESC 2021\n..............................................................................\n8\nESC Guidelines\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/35/3427/6358547 by guest on 14 January 2026",

In addition, attention has\nincreased in other areas, such as how to systematically minimize pro-\ncedural risk and avoid complications of cardiac pacing (section 9), how\nto manage patients with pacemakers in special situations, such as when\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or irradiation are needed (section\n11), how to follow patients with a pacemaker with emphasis on the\nuse of remote monitoring, and how to include shared decision-making\nin caring for this patient population (section 12).\nThe last pacing guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology\n(ESC) were published in 2013; therefore, a new set of guidelines was\nfelt to be timely and necessary.\nTo address these topics, a Task Force was established to create\nthe new guidelines.

CRT delivers biventricular pacing to correct elec-\ntromechanical dyssynchrony in order to increase cardiac output.36 In\nmultiple trials, CRT has shown a significant morbidity and mortality\nbenefit in specific patient groups with reduced left ventricular ejec-\ntion fraction (LVEF).37\u000240\n3.4.4\nAlternative methods (conduction system pacing,\nleadless pacing)\n3.4.4.1 Conduction system pacing\nCompared with right ventricular (RV) pacing, His bundle pacing\n(HBP) provides a more physiological simultaneous electrical activa-\ntion of the ventricles via the His\u0002Purkinje system. HBP can restore\nconduction in a subset of patients with high-degree AVB, and shorten\nQRS duration in some patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB)\nor right bundle branch block (RBBB).41\u000244 More studies are ongoing\nand required to evaluate whether HBP has clinical benefits over CRT\nor RV pacing. In addition, left bundle branch area pacing is being\nstudied as a pacing modality for patients in whom the conduction dis-\nease is too distal for HBP (see section 7.3).\n3.4.4.2 Leadless pacing\nMiniaturized, intracardiac leadless pacemakers have been introduced.\nThese devices are inserted percutaneously through the femoral vein\nand implanted directly in the RV wall using customized catheter-\nbased delivery systems. The first-generation leadless pacemakers\nhave been proven to provide effective single-chamber pacing\ntherapy.45\u000250 Albeit a promising technology, potential difficulty with\nleadless pacemaker retrieval at the end of service is a limitation. Thus\nfar, there are no randomized controlled data available to compare\nclinical outcomes between leadless pacing and single-chamber trans-\nvenous pacing.\n3.4.5\nPacing modes\nTechnological advances in pacemaker therapy have resulted in a wide\nvariety of pacing modalities. Pacemakers can sense the heart’s intrin-\nsic electrical activity and restore the rate and AV sequence of cardiac\nactivation. Abnormal cardiac automaticity and conduction may be\ntreated by single-lead atrial sensing/pacing, single-lead ventricular\nsensing/pacing, single leads that pace the right ventricle (RV) and\nsense both the atrium and ventricle, and dual-lead systems that sense\nand pace the right atrium (RA) and RV. For common pacing modes,\nrefer to Supplementary Table 2. The choice of the optimal pacing\nmode in the presence of conduction disturbances is driven by the\nunderlying morbidity, the impact of pacing therapy on morbidity, and\nthe potential harmful effect of the chosen pacing modality. The\nchoice of pacing modes in specific situations is discussed in section 5.\n3.4.6\nRate-responsive pacing\nThe sinus node modulates the heart rate during different types and\nloads of exercise (i.e. physical exercise, emotions, postural change,\nand fever) proportional to the metabolic demand. Rate-responsive\npacemaker systems strive to produce an appropriate compensatory\nheart rate during emotional or physical activity by sensing body\nmotion/acceleration, minute ventilation, intracardiac impedance, or\nother surrogates of physical and mental stress, and are indicated in\ncases of chronotropic incompetence.51\u000257 Dual-sensing rate-respon-\nsive pacing (e.g. accelerometer and minute ventilation) may be used\nin selected patients.58 A brief overview of the most commonly used\nrate-responsive pacing sensors is given in Supplementary Table 3.\n3.5 Sex differences\nPacing indications and complication rates differ between male and\nfemale patients. In male patients, primary pacemaker implantation is\nmore often indicated for AVB and less so for SND and atrial fibrilla-\ntion (AF) with bradycardia.59,60 In female patients, the rate of\nprocedure-related adverse events is significantly higher, corrected\nfor age and type of device. This higher rate is driven mostly by pneu-\nmothorax, pericardial effusion, and pocket haematomas.59\u000261\nPossible explanations for this are a smaller body size in women and\nanatomical differences, such as smaller vein diameters and RV\ndiameters.\n4 Evaluation of the patient with\nsuspected or documented\nbradycardia or conduction system\ndisease\n4.1 History and physical examination\nA careful history and physical examination are essential for the evalu-\nation of patients with suspected or documented bradycardia\n(Figure 3).

The history should be focused on frequency,\nseverity, and duration of symptoms that might suggest bradycardia or\nconduction system disease. The relationship of symptoms to physical\nactivity, emotional distress, positional changes, medical treatment\n(Table 6), and typical triggers (e.g. urination, defecation, cough, pro-\nlonged standing, and shaving) should be explored too, as well as pulse\nrate if measured during an episode.\nFamily history may be especially important in young patients with\nprogressive cardiac conduction disease either isolated or in associa-\ntion with cardiomyopathies and/or myopathies.64,65\nPhysical examination should focus on manifestations of bradycar-\ndia and signs of underlying structural heart disease or systemic disor-\nders (Table 7).

CRT delivers biventricular pacing to correct elec-\ntromechanical dyssynchrony in order to increase cardiac output.36 In\nmultiple trials, CRT has shown a significant morbidity and mortality\nbenefit in specific patient groups with reduced left ventricular ejec-\ntion fraction (LVEF).37\u000240\n3.4.4\nAlternative methods (conduction system pacing,\nleadless pacing)\n3.4.4.1 Conduction system pacing\nCompared with right ventricular (RV) pacing, His bundle pacing\n(HBP) provides a more physiological simultaneous electrical activa-\ntion of the ventricles via the His\u0002Purkinje system. HBP can restore\nconduction in a subset of patients with high-degree AVB, and shorten\nQRS duration in some patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB)\nor right bundle branch block (RBBB).41\u000244 More studies are ongoing\nand required to evaluate whether HBP has clinical benefits over CRT\nor RV pacing. In addition, left bundle branch area pacing is being\nstudied as a pacing modality for patients in whom the conduction dis-\nease is too distal for HBP (see section 7.3).\n3.4.4.2 Leadless pacing\nMiniaturized, intracardiac leadless pacemakers have been introduced.\nThese devices are inserted percutaneously through the femoral vein\nand implanted directly in the RV wall using customized catheter-\nbased delivery systems. The first-generation leadless pacemakers\nhave been proven to provide effective single-chamber pacing\ntherapy.45\u000250 Albeit a promising technology, potential difficulty with\nleadless pacemaker retrieval at the end of service is a limitation. Thus\nfar, there are no randomized controlled data available to compare\nclinical outcomes between leadless pacing and single-chamber trans-\nvenous pacing.\n3.4.5\nPacing modes\nTechnological advances in pacemaker therapy have resulted in a wide\nvariety of pacing modalities. Pacemakers can sense the heart’s intrin-\nsic electrical activity and restore the rate and AV sequence of cardiac\nactivation. Abnormal cardiac automaticity and conduction may be\ntreated by single-lead atrial sensing/pacing, single-lead ventricular\nsensing/pacing, single leads that pace the right ventricle (RV) and\nsense both the atrium and ventricle, and dual-lead systems that sense\nand pace the right atrium (RA) and RV. For common pacing modes,\nrefer to Supplementary Table 2. The choice of the optimal pacing\nmode in the presence of conduction disturbances is driven by the\nunderlying morbidity, the impact of pacing therapy on morbidity, and\nthe potential harmful effect of the chosen pacing modality. The\nchoice of pacing modes in specific situations is discussed in section 5.\n3.4.6\nRate-responsive pacing\nThe sinus node modulates the heart rate during different types and\nloads of exercise (i.e. physical exercise, emotions, postural change,\nand fever) proportional to the metabolic demand.

Symptoms occurring\nduring exercise are likely to be due to cardiac causes, whereas symp-\ntoms occurring after exercise are usually caused by a reflex\nmechanism.\nExercise testing can be used to diagnose symptomatic chrono-\ntropic incompetence, defined as an inability to increase the heart rate\ncommensurate with the increased metabolic demands of physical\nactivity.74,75 The most commonly used definition of chronotropic\nincompetence has been failure to reach 80% of the expected heart\nrate reserve. Expected heart rate reserve is defined as the difference\nbetween the age-predicted maximal heart rate (220 \u0002 age) and the\nresting heart rate. However, some medical treatments and comor-\nbidities cause exercise intolerance and make the diagnosis of chrono-\ntropic incompetence by exercise testing more difficult.\nIn patients with exercise-related symptoms, the development or\nprogression of AVB may occasionally be the underlying cause.\nTachycardia-related exercise-induced second-degree and complete\nAVB have been shown to be located distal to the AVN and predict\nprogression to permanent AVB.76\u000278 Usually, these patients show\nintraventricular conduction abnormalities on the resting ECG, but a\nnormal resting ECG has also been described in such cases.77,79\nExercise testing may expose advanced infranodal AVB in the pres-\nence of conduction system disease of uncertain location.\nIn rare cases, conduction disturbances induced by exercise are\ncaused by myocardial ischaemia or coronary vasospasm, and exercise\ntesting may reproduce the symptoms.80,81\nThere are no data supporting an indication for exercise testing in\npatients without exercise-related symptoms.

When coronary artery disease\nis suspected, coronary computed tomography (CT), angiography, or\nstress imaging is recommended.82 Cardiovascular magnetic reso-\nnance (CMR) and nuclear imaging techniques provide information on\ntissue characterization (inflammation, fibrosis/scar) and should be\nconsidered before pacemaker implantation when specific aetiologies\nassociated with conduction abnormalities are suspected (specially in\nyoung patients). Late gadolinium contrast enhanced (LGE) and T2\nCMR techniques allow the diagnosis of specific causes of conduction\ndisturbances (i.e. sarcoidosis and myocarditis). Late gadolinium con-\ntrast enhancement CMR helps in the decision-making of individuals\nwith arrhythmic events; the presence of large areas of LGE (scar/fib-\nrosis) has been linked to an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias\nregardless of LVEF and may indicate the need for an implantable\ncardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).83\u000285 T2 CMR sequences are suited\nfor the detection of myocardial inflammation (i.e. oedema and hyper-\naemia) as a potential cause of transitory conduction abnormalities\nthat may not need permanent pacemaker implantation.86 Similarly,\npositron emission tomography (PET) combined with CMR or CT\nhelps in the diagnosis of inflammatory activity status of infiltrative car-\ndiomyopathies (i.e. sarcoidosis).87,88\n4.3.4\nLaboratory tests\nLaboratory tests, including full blood counts, prothrombin time, par-\ntial thromboplastin time, renal function, and electrolyte measure-\nments, are warranted as part of pre-procedural planning for\npacemaker implantation.\nBradycardia or AVB may be secondary to other conditions\n(Table 7). When suspected, laboratory data are useful for identifying\nand treating these conditions (e.g. thyroid function, Lyme titre to\ndiagnose myocarditis in a young person with AVB, endocarditis,\nhyperkalaemia, digitalis levels, and hypercalcaemia).89\u000294\n4.3.5\nGenetic testing\nMost cardiac conduction disorders are due to either ageing or struc-\ntural abnormalities of the cardiac conduction system caused by\nunderlying structural heart disease. Genes responsible for inherited\ncardiac diseases associated with cardiac conduction disorders have\nbeen identified.65,95,96\nGenetic mutations have been linked to a range of abnormalities\nthat may present in isolated forms of cardiac conduction disorder or\nin association with cardiomyopathy, congenital cardiac anomalies, or\nextra-cardiac disorders. Most genetically mediated cardiac conduc-\ntion disorders have an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance65,95\n(Supplementary Table 5).\nProgressive\ncardiac\nconduction\ndisease\n(PCCD)\nmay\nbe\ndiagnosed in the presence of unexplained progressive conduction\nabnormalities in young (<50 years) individuals with structurally nor-\nmal hearts in the absence of skeletal myopathies, especially if there is\na family history of PCCD.97 Common PCCD-associated genes are\nSCN5A and TRPM4 for isolated forms and LMNA for PCCD associ-\nated with HF.\nThe diagnosis of PCCD in an index patient is based on clinical data\nincluding history, family history, and 12-lead ECG. The potential pres-\nence of congenital heart disease (CHD) and/or cardiomyopathy must\nbe investigated with cardiac imaging.\nEarly-onset PCCD, either isolated or with concomitant structural\nheart disease, should prompt consideration of PCCD genetic testing,\nparticularly in patients with a positive family history of conduction\nabnormalities, pacemaker implants, or sudden death.97\nA consensus panel has endorsed mutation-specific genetic testing\nfor family members and appropriate relatives after the identification\nof a PCCD causative mutation in an index case. Such testing can be\ndeferred in asymptomatic children because of the age-dependent\nnature of cardiac conduction diseases and incomplete penetrance.65\nHowever, every case should be individually evaluated depending of\nthe risk of the detected mutation.\nAsymptomatic family members who are positive for the family’s\nPCCD-associated mutation should be regularly followed for devel-\nopment of cardiac conduction disease-related symptoms, deteriora-\ntion of cardiac conduction, and beginning of HF.\nRecommendations regarding imaging before\nimplantation\nRecommendations\nClassa\nLevelb\nCardiac imaging is recommended in patients\nwith suspected or documented symptomatic\nbradycardia to evaluate the presence of struc-\ntural heart disease, to determine LV systolic\nfunction, and to diagnose potential causes of\nconduction disturbances.\nI\nC\nMultimodality imaging (CMR, CT, or PET) should\nbe considered for myocardial tissue character-\nization in the diagnosis of speciﬁc pathologies\nassociated with conduction abnormalities need-\ning pacemaker implantation, particularly in\npatients younger than 60 years.83\u000286,88\nIIa\nC\nCMR = cardiovascular magnetic resonance; CT = computed tomography; LV =\nleft ventricular; PET = positron emission tomography.\naClass of recommendation.\nbLevel of evidence.\nRecommendations for laboratory tests\nRecommendations\nClassa\nLevelb\nIn addition to pre-implantation laboratory tests,c\nspeciﬁc laboratory tests are recommended in\npatients with clinical suspicion for potential\nunderlying causes of reversible bradycardia (e.g.\nthyroid function tests, Lyme titre, digitalis level,\npotassium, calcium, and pH) to diagnose and\ntreat these conditions.90\u000294\nI\nC\naClass of recommendation.\nbLevel of evidence.\ncComplete blood counts, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, serum\ncreatinine, and electrolytes.\nESC 2021\nESC 2021\n...................................................\n20\nESC Guidelines\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/35/3427/6358547 by guest on 14 January 2026",

Late gadolinium con-\ntrast enhancement CMR helps in the decision-making of individuals\nwith arrhythmic events; the presence of large areas of LGE (scar/fib-\nrosis) has been linked to an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias\nregardless of LVEF and may indicate the need for an implantable\ncardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).83\u000285 T2 CMR sequences are suited\nfor the detection of myocardial inflammation (i.e. oedema and hyper-\naemia) as a potential cause of transitory conduction abnormalities\nthat may not need permanent pacemaker implantation.86 Similarly,\npositron emission tomography (PET) combined with CMR or CT\nhelps in the diagnosis of inflammatory activity status of infiltrative car-\ndiomyopathies (i.e. sarcoidosis).87,88\n4.3.4\nLaboratory tests\nLaboratory tests, including full blood counts, prothrombin time, par-\ntial thromboplastin time, renal function, and electrolyte measure-\nments, are warranted as part of pre-procedural planning for\npacemaker implantation.\nBradycardia or AVB may be secondary to other conditions\n(Table 7). When suspected, laboratory data are useful for identifying\nand treating these conditions (e.g. thyroid function, Lyme titre to\ndiagnose myocarditis in a young person with AVB, endocarditis,\nhyperkalaemia, digitalis levels, and hypercalcaemia).89\u000294\n4.3.5\nGenetic testing\nMost cardiac conduction disorders are due to either ageing or struc-\ntural abnormalities of the cardiac conduction system caused by\nunderlying structural heart disease. Genes responsible for inherited\ncardiac diseases associated with cardiac conduction disorders have\nbeen identified.65,95,96\nGenetic mutations have been linked to a range of abnormalities\nthat may present in isolated forms of cardiac conduction disorder or\nin association with cardiomyopathy, congenital cardiac anomalies, or\nextra-cardiac disorders. Most genetically mediated cardiac conduc-\ntion disorders have an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance65,95\n(Supplementary Table 5).\nProgressive\ncardiac\nconduction\ndisease\n(PCCD)\nmay\nbe\ndiagnosed in the presence of unexplained progressive conduction\nabnormalities in young (<50 years) individuals with structurally nor-\nmal hearts in the absence of skeletal myopathies, especially if there is\na family history of PCCD.97 Common PCCD-associated genes are\nSCN5A and TRPM4 for isolated forms and LMNA for PCCD associ-\nated with HF.\nThe diagnosis of PCCD in an index patient is based on clinical data\nincluding history, family history, and 12-lead ECG. The potential pres-\nence of congenital heart disease (CHD) and/or cardiomyopathy must\nbe investigated with cardiac imaging.\nEarly-onset PCCD, either isolated or with concomitant structural\nheart disease, should prompt consideration of PCCD genetic testing,\nparticularly in patients with a positive family history of conduction\nabnormalities, pacemaker implants, or sudden death.97\nA consensus panel has endorsed mutation-specific genetic testing\nfor family members and appropriate relatives after the identification\nof a PCCD causative mutation in an index case. Such testing can be\ndeferred in asymptomatic children because of the age-dependent\nnature of cardiac conduction diseases and incomplete penetrance.65\nHowever, every case should be individually evaluated depending of\nthe risk of the detected mutation.\nAsymptomatic family members who are positive for the family’s\nPCCD-associated mutation should be regularly followed for devel-\nopment of cardiac conduction disease-related symptoms, deteriora-\ntion of cardiac conduction, and beginning of HF.\nRecommendations regarding imaging before\nimplantation\nRecommendations\nClassa\nLevelb\nCardiac imaging is recommended in patients\nwith suspected or documented symptomatic\nbradycardia to evaluate the presence of struc-\ntural heart disease, to determine LV systolic\nfunction, and to diagnose potential causes of\nconduction disturbances.\nI\nC\nMultimodality imaging (CMR, CT, or PET) should\nbe considered for myocardial tissue character-\nization in the diagnosis of speciﬁc pathologies\nassociated with conduction abnormalities need-\ning pacemaker implantation, particularly in\npatients younger than 60 years.83\u000286,88\nIIa\nC\nCMR = cardiovascular magnetic resonance; CT = computed tomography; LV =\nleft ventricular; PET = positron emission tomography.\naClass of recommendation.\nbLevel of evidence.\nRecommendations for laboratory tests\nRecommendations\nClassa\nLevelb\nIn addition to pre-implantation laboratory tests,c\nspeciﬁc laboratory tests are recommended in\npatients with clinical suspicion for potential\nunderlying causes of reversible bradycardia (e.g.\nthyroid function tests, Lyme titre, digitalis level,\npotassium, calcium, and pH) to diagnose and\ntreat these conditions.90\u000294\nI\nC\naClass of recommendation.\nbLevel of evidence.\ncComplete blood counts, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, serum\ncreatinine, and electrolytes.\nESC 2021\nESC 2021\n...................................................\n20\nESC Guidelines\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/35/3427/6358547 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n............................................\n4.3.6\nSleep evaluation\nNocturnal bradyarrhythmias are common in the general population.\nIn most circumstances, these are physiological, vagally mediated\nasymptomatic events, which do not require intervention.98\u0002100\nPatients with sleep apnoea syndrome (SAS) have a higher preva-\nlence of sleep-related bradycardia (both sinus and conduction system\nrelated) during apnoeic episodes.101,102 SAS-induced hypoxaemia is a\nkey mechanism leading to an increased vagal tone and bradycardic\nrhythm disorders.101,102 Another rare mechanism of sleep-related\nbradycardia (usually in the form of prolonged sinus arrest) is rapid\neye movement sleep-related bradycardia, unrelated to apnoea.

Therefore, EPS is pre-\nferred over ILR in patients with syncope who have a high pre-test\nprobability for significant conduction disease (e.g. abnormal ECG,\nBBB, ischaemic heart disease, or scar-related cardiomyopathy). For\npatients with a low pre-test probability (no structural heart disease,\nnormal ECG), ILR is preferred over EPS. EPS is also preferred when\nthere is a high likelihood that another syncopal episode will be dan-\ngerous or life-threatening and an immediate diagnosis is likely if EPS is\nperformed.\nA negative EPS does not exclude an arrhythmic syncope, and fur-\nther evaluation is warranted. Approximately one-third of patients\nwith a negative EPS in whom an ILR is implanted develop AVB at fol-\nlow-up.123\n5 Cardiac pacing for bradycardia\nand conduction system disease\n5.1 Pacing for sinus node dysfunction\nSND, also known as sick sinus syndrome, comprises a wide spectrum\nof sinoatrial dysfunctions, ranging from sinus bradycardia, sinoatrial\nblock, and sinus arrest to bradycardia\u0002tachycardia syndrome.124,125\nAn additional manifestation of SND is an inadequate chronotropic\nresponse to exercise, reported as chronotropic incompetence.\n5.1.1\nIndications for pacing\n5.1.1.1 Sinus node dysfunction\nIn general, pacing for asymptomatic SND has never been shown to\naffect prognosis, as opposed to pacing for AVB. Therefore, SND can\nbe considered as an appropriate indication for permanent pacing\nonly when bradycardia due to SND is symptomatic.126 Patients with\nSND may manifest symptoms attributable to bradyarrhythmia and/or\nsymptoms of accompanying atrial tachyarrhythmias in the bradycar-\ndia\u0002tachycardia form of the disease.

Control of atrial\ntachyarrhythmias in patients presenting with high ventricular rates\nmay be difficult before implant, as drugs prescribed for rate control\nmay worsen bradyarrhythmias. Ablation of the atrial tachyarrhythmia,\nmainly AF, has been proposed in lieu of pacing and continuing medi-\ncations for selected patients,136\u0002138 but no data are available from\nRCTs to show whether catheter ablation of AF is non-inferior to car-\ndiac pacing with respect to bradycardia-related symptoms in patients\nwith bradycardia\u0002tachycardia syndrome.139 If drug treatment is\nchosen, bradyarrhythmias during drug treatment for rate or rhythm\ncontrol may be managed by dose reduction or discontinuation as an\nalternative to cardiac pacing, but in many cases bradyarrhythmias\npersist.\n5.1.2\nPacing mode and algorithm selection\nIn patients with SND, controlled studies found that DDD was supe-\nrior to single-chamber ventricular pacing in reducing the incidence of\nAF. These studies also showed some effect of DDD pacing on the\noccurrence of stroke.140,141 Dual-chamber pacing reduces the risk of\npacemaker syndrome, which may occur in more than a quarter of\npatients with SND.21,142 Pacemaker syndrome is associated with a\nreduction in quality of life and usually justifies the preference for\nDDD vs. ventricular rate-modulated pacing in SND, when reason-\nable.143 Potential exceptions are very elderly and/or frail patients\nwith infrequent pauses who have limited functional capacity and/or a\nshort expected survival. In these patients, the benefit of DDD(R) vs.\nVVIR pacing is expected to have limited or no clinical impact, and the\nincremental risk of complications related to the second atrial lead\nrequired in DDD(R) implants should also be considered when\nchoosing the pacing mode. In patients with SND treated with a DDD\npacemaker, programming of the AV interval and specific algorithms\nfor minimizing RV pacing may further reduce the risk of AF and par-\nticularly of persistent AF.144 Dual-chamber pacing is safer and more\nsustainable than atrial-only pacing modes used in the past,127 even\nthough single-lead atrial pacing was found to be superior to single-\nlead ventricular pacing.145,146 The results of studies that evaluated dif-\nferent pacing modes in bradyarrhythmias, including in some cases\nboth SND and AVB, are shown in Supplementary Table 6.\nWith regard to the choice between DDD(R) and atrial pacing\natrial sensing inhibited-response rate-adaptive (AAIR) pacing, an RCT\nwith only 177 patients suggested a reduced risk of AF with AAIR.147\nHowever, the most recent DANish Multicenter Randomized Trial on\nSingle Lead Atrial PACing vs. Dual Chamber Pacing in Sick Sinus\nSyndrome (DANPACE), which enrolled 1415 patients followed for a\nmean of 5.4 years, found no difference between DDD(R) and AAIR\npacing in all-cause mortality.127 The DANPACE trial also found a\nhigher incidence of paroxysmal AF [hazard ratio (HR) 1.27] and a\ntwo-fold increased risk of pacemaker reoperation with AAIR, with\nAVB developing in 0.6\u00021.9% of patients every year.127 These findings\nsupport the routine use of DDD(R) rather than AAIR pacing in\npatients with SND.\nIn view of these data, DDD(R) is the pacing mode of first choice in\nSND (Figure 5). Unnecessary RV pacing should be systematically\navoided in patients with SND, because it may cause AF and deteriora-\ntion of HF, particularly if systolic function is impaired or border-\nline.144,148 This can be achieved by programming of the AV interval\nor using specific algorithms for minimizing RV pacing. Programming\nan excessively long AV interval to avoid RV pacing in patients with\nprolonged AV conduction may be disadvantageous from a haemody-\nnamic point of view by causing diastolic mitral regurgitation, which\nmay lead to symptoms and/or AF.144,149,150\nPacing algorithms for minimizing ventricular pacing are often used\nin SND.144,151 A meta-analysis of algorithms for minimizing RV pacing\nfailed to show a significant effect compared with conventional DDD\npacing in patients with normal ventricular function with regard to\nendpoints such as incidence of persistent/permanent AF, all-cause\nhospitalization, and all-cause mortality.152 However, the rationale for\nreducing unnecessary RV pacing remains strong and is coupled with\nthe benefits of extending device longevity.151,152 Some manufacturer-\nspecific algorithms are more effective in minimizing ventricular pacing,\nbut may confer disadvantages in allowing decoupling between atria\nand ventricles.153,154 Rarely, algorithms designed to minimize ventric-\nular pacing can cause life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias that are\npause dependent or pause triggered.155\u0002158 No direct comparison\nof these algorithms has been performed so far, but pooled data from\nrandomized trials do not show clear-cut superiority of any specific\nalgorithm in improving clinical outcome.152,159\nIn patients with severely reduced LVEF and a SND indication for\npacing, in whom a high percentage of ventricular pacing is expected,\nan indication for CRT or HBP should be evaluated (see section 6 on\nCRT and section 7 on HBP).\nThe role of pacing algorithms for preventing AF has been the sub-\nject of controversy. A series of algorithms for preventing/suppressing\nAF has been tested, such as dynamic atrial overdrive pacing, atrial\npacing in response to atrial premature beats, pacing in response to\nexercise, and post-mode-switch pacing. The clinical evaluation of\nthese algorithms, also applied at different atrial pacing sites, is not\nconvincing and no clinical benefit with regard to major clinical end-\npoints has been demonstrated.160,161\nAtrial antitachycardia pacing [ATP; i.e. delivery of atrial stimuli at\nhigh frequencies to convert an atrial tachyarrhythmia to sinus rhythm\n(SR)] has also been tested for reducing the atrial tachyarrhythmia\nburden and counteracting the tendency over time towards progres-\nsion to permanent AF.162 Conventional delivery of atrial ATP in a\nway that mirrors the delivery of ventricular ATP (bursts/ramp at\narrhythmia onset) has a relatively low success rate, and indeed the tri-\nals based on conventional atrial ATP showed no benefit on AF bur-\nden or clinical events.163 A new form of ATP delivery has been\n24\nESC Guidelines\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/35/3427/6358547 by guest on 14 January 2026",

First-degree AVB is usually\nasymptomatic. Syncope and dizziness are mainly observed in high-\ndegree and complete AVB, especially in the paroxysmal forms. HF\nsymptoms are more common in chronic AVB with permanent brady-\ncardia, but can also be observed in first-degree AVB with a very pro-\nlonged PR interval. Given the commonly advanced age at onset of\nAVB, manifestations of fatigue, exertional intolerance, and HF are\nsometimes underestimated. Deterioration of cognitive functions is\noften only speculative so that the possibilities of improvement after\nimplantation of a pacemaker are unpredictable and unlikely. Death in\npatients with untreated AVB is due not only to HF secondary to low\ncardiac output, but also to SCD caused by prolonged asystole or\nbradycardia-triggered ventricular tachyarrhythmia. Although RCTs of\npacing in AVB have not been performed, it is clear from several\nobservational studies that pacing prevents recurrence of syncope and\nimproves survival.10\u000212\n5.2.1.1 First-degree atrioventricular block\nUsually the prognosis is good in the absence of structural heart\ndisease, and progression to high-degree block is uncommon.175 The\nindication for pacing relies on an established correlation between\nsymptoms and AVB. There is weak evidence to show that marked PR\nprolongation (i.e. >_300 ms), particularly when it persists or is pro-\nlonged during exercise, can lead to symptoms similar to pacemaker\nsyndrome and/or that these can improve with pacing.176 Symptom\ncorrelation is crucial, although it may be difficult if these are non-\nspecific and subtle. In the absence of a clear correlation, a pacemaker\nis generally not indicated.\n5.2.1.2 Second-degree type I atrioventricular block (Mobitz type I or\nWenckebach)\nIn addition to the presence or absence of symptoms, the risk of pro-\ngression to higher degrees of AVB should be considered. Supranodal\nblock has a benign course, and the risk of progression to type II or a\nhigher degree of AV block is low.

First-degree AVB is usually\nasymptomatic. Syncope and dizziness are mainly observed in high-\ndegree and complete AVB, especially in the paroxysmal forms. HF\nsymptoms are more common in chronic AVB with permanent brady-\ncardia, but can also be observed in first-degree AVB with a very pro-\nlonged PR interval.

Death in\npatients with untreated AVB is due not only to HF secondary to low\ncardiac output, but also to SCD caused by prolonged asystole or\nbradycardia-triggered ventricular tachyarrhythmia.

In a meta-analysis of 20 crossover\ntrials, DDD was associated with an improved exercise capacity com-\npared with ventricular pacing. However, the effect was driven by\nnon-rate-modulated ventricular pacemakers, and no benefit was\nobserved from the comparison of DDD with VVIR pacing.182\nPacemaker syndrome is associated with reduction in quality of life\nand may require a reintervention for upgrading, justifying the prefer-\nence for DDD when reasonable (i.e. in patients who do not present\nwith significant frailty, very advanced age, significant comorbidities\nlimiting their life expectancy, or a very limited mobility). Another con-\nsideration is the diagnosis of AF, which is more reliable from device\ndata in patients with DDD pacemakers. On a case by case basis, in\nfrail elderly patients, and/or when AVB is paroxysmal and pacing\nanticipated to be infrequent, VVIR pacing may be considered as it\ncarries a lower complication rate.140\nThere is strong evidence to show that chronic conventional RV\npacing may be deleterious in some patients and may lead to LV dys-\nfunction and HF,148 even when AV synchrony is maintained.183 This\neffect is only partly explained by the abnormal activation sequence\nand may involve myocardial perfusion, and humoral, cellular, and\nmolecular changes.184,185 Compared with a matched control cohort,\npatients with a pacemaker and an RV lead have an increased risk of\nHF, which is also associated with older age, previous MI, kidney dis-\nease, and male sex.186 Pacing-induced cardiomyopathy occurs in\n10\u000220% of patients after 2\u00024 years of RV pacing.186\u0002188 It is associ-\nated with a >20% RV pacing burden.187\u0002190 However, there are no\ndata to support that any percentage of RV pacing can be considered\nas defining a true limit below which RV pacing is safe and beyond\nwhich RV pacing is harmful.

During prolonged\nmonitoring, long ventricular pauses may be detected.191 In patients\nwith AF and no permanent AVB or symptoms, there is no identifiable,\nminimum pause duration as an indication for pacing. In the absence of\na potentially reversible cause, bradycardia or inappropriate chrono-\ntropic response (due to either intermittent or complete AVB) associ-\nated or reasonably correlated with symptoms is an indication for\ncardiac pacing. Any high-degree or infranodal block is also an indica-\ntion for pacing, even in the absence of symptoms. In the absence of\nsymptoms due to bradycardia and of high-degree or infranodal block,\npacing is unlikely to be beneficial and is not indicated.\nIn patients with AF who undergo atrioventricular junction (AVJ)\nablation to control rapid ventricular rates, there is evidence to show\nthat AVJ ablation plus RV pacing improves symptoms and quality of\nlife.192 In contrast, neutral results were found regarding the progres-\nsion of HF, hospitalization, and mortality,193 except in one study.194\nCompared with pharmacological rate control, AVJ ablation and CRT\nreduced the risks of death due to HF, hospitalization due to HF, or\nworsening HF by 62%, and improved specific symptoms of AF by\n36% in elderly patients with permanent AF and narrow QRS.195 In\nother studies, this beneficial effect was limited to patients with HF or\nreduced ejection fraction (EF).166,196 For further discussion of the\nrole of CRT following AVJ ablation, refer to section 6.

In a meta-analysis of 20 crossover\ntrials, DDD was associated with an improved exercise capacity com-\npared with ventricular pacing. However, the effect was driven by\nnon-rate-modulated ventricular pacemakers, and no benefit was\nobserved from the comparison of DDD with VVIR pacing.182\nPacemaker syndrome is associated with reduction in quality of life\nand may require a reintervention for upgrading, justifying the prefer-\nence for DDD when reasonable (i.e. in patients who do not present\nwith significant frailty, very advanced age, significant comorbidities\nlimiting their life expectancy, or a very limited mobility). Another con-\nsideration is the diagnosis of AF, which is more reliable from device\ndata in patients with DDD pacemakers. On a case by case basis, in\nfrail elderly patients, and/or when AVB is paroxysmal and pacing\nanticipated to be infrequent, VVIR pacing may be considered as it\ncarries a lower complication rate.140\nThere is strong evidence to show that chronic conventional RV\npacing may be deleterious in some patients and may lead to LV dys-\nfunction and HF,148 even when AV synchrony is maintained.183 This\neffect is only partly explained by the abnormal activation sequence\nand may involve myocardial perfusion, and humoral, cellular, and\nmolecular changes.184,185 Compared with a matched control cohort,\npatients with a pacemaker and an RV lead have an increased risk of\nHF, which is also associated with older age, previous MI, kidney dis-\nease, and male sex.186 Pacing-induced cardiomyopathy occurs in\n10\u000220% of patients after 2\u00024 years of RV pacing.186\u0002188 It is associ-\nated with a >20% RV pacing burden.187\u0002190 However, there are no\ndata to support that any percentage of RV pacing can be considered\nas defining a true limit below which RV pacing is safe and beyond\nwhich RV pacing is harmful. For discussion of potential indications for\nCRT and/or HBP to prevent pacing-induced cardiomyopathy, please\nrefer to sections 6 and 7.\n5.2.2.2 Atrioventricular block in the case of permanent atrial fibrillation\nIn the presence of AF, AVB should be suspected if the ventricular\nrate is slow and the ventricular rhythm regular. During prolonged\nmonitoring, long ventricular pauses may be detected.191 In patients\nwith AF and no permanent AVB or symptoms, there is no identifiable,\nminimum pause duration as an indication for pacing. In the absence of\na potentially reversible cause, bradycardia or inappropriate chrono-\ntropic response (due to either intermittent or complete AVB) associ-\nated or reasonably correlated with symptoms is an indication for\ncardiac pacing. Any high-degree or infranodal block is also an indica-\ntion for pacing, even in the absence of symptoms. In the absence of\nsymptoms due to bradycardia and of high-degree or infranodal block,\npacing is unlikely to be beneficial and is not indicated.\nIn patients with AF who undergo atrioventricular junction (AVJ)\nablation to control rapid ventricular rates, there is evidence to show\nthat AVJ ablation plus RV pacing improves symptoms and quality of\nlife.192 In contrast, neutral results were found regarding the progres-\nsion of HF, hospitalization, and mortality,193 except in one study.194\nCompared with pharmacological rate control, AVJ ablation and CRT\nreduced the risks of death due to HF, hospitalization due to HF, or\nworsening HF by 62%, and improved specific symptoms of AF by\n36% in elderly patients with permanent AF and narrow QRS.195 In\nother studies, this beneficial effect was limited to patients with HF or\nreduced ejection fraction (EF).166,196 For further discussion of the\nrole of CRT following AVJ ablation, refer to section 6.

Indeed, in patients with a negative EPS,\nintermittent or stable AVB was documented by ILR in \u000350% of cases.\nTherefore, elderly patients with bifascicular block and unexplained\nsyncope might benefit from an empirical pacemaker, especially in\nunpredictable and recurrent syncope that exposes the patient to a\nhigh risk of traumatic recurrences. The decision to implant a pace-\nmaker in these patients should be based on individual risk\u0002benefit\nevaluation.213\n5.3.1.3 Alternating bundle branch block\nThis rare condition refers to situations in which there is clear ECG\nevidence for block in all three fascicles on successive ECGs; examples\nare LBBB and RBBB morphologies on successive ECGs, or RBBB\nwith associated left anterior fascicular block on one ECG and left\nposterior fascicular block on another ECG.214 There is general con-\nsensus that this phenomenon is associated with significant infranodal\ndisease and that patients will progress rapidly toward AVB.\nTherefore, a pacemaker should be implanted as soon as the alternat-\ning BBB is detected, even in the absence of symptoms.\n5.3.1.4 Bundle branch block without symptoms\nPermanent pacemaker implantation is not indicated for BBB without\nsymptoms, with the exception of alternating BBB, because only a\nminority\nof\nthese\npatients\nwill\ndevelop\nAVB\n(1\u00022%\nper\nyear).115,121,215 The risks of pacemaker implantation and long-term\ntransvenous lead complications are higher than the benefits of pace-\nmaker implantation.216,217\n5.3.1.5 Patients with neuromuscular diseases\nIn patients with neuromuscular diseases, cardiac pacing should be\nconsidered, as any degree of fascicular block can progress unpredict-\nably, even in the absence of symptoms (see section 8.5).\n5.3.2\nPacing mode and algorithm selection\nIn intermittent bradycardia, pacing may be required only for short\nperiods. In this situation, the benefits of bradycardia and pause pre-\nvention must be weighed against the detrimental effects of perma-\nnent\npacing,\nparticularly\npacing-induced\nHF.\nLow\nbase-rate\nprogramming to achieve backup pacing, and manual adaptation of AV\ninterval, programming AV hysteresis, or other specific algorithms\npreventing unnecessary RV pacing, play a particularly important role\nin this patient group.144,148\nIn patients in SR, the optimal pacing mode is DDD. The strong evi-\ndence of superiority of DDD vs. VVI pacing is limited to improvement\nin symptoms and quality of life. Conversely, there is strong evidence\nof\nnon-superiority\nwith\nregard\nto\nsurvival\nand\nmorbidity.20\nTherefore, in elderly or frail patients with intermittent bradycardia,\nthe decision regarding the pacing mode should be made on an individ-\nual basis, taking into consideration the increased complication risk\nand costs of DDD (Figure 5).\nVDD may be a pacing mode alternative for patients with advanced\nAV conduction abnormalities and spared sinus node function. In\ncomparison with DDD, VDD system implantation is associated with\nfewer complications, shorter procedure and fluoroscopy times, and a\nhigh incidence of atrial undersensing.218 Potential atrial undersensing\nis contributing to the low use of this system as most operators are\naiming for AV synchrony.\nRecommendations for pacing in patients with bundle\nbranch block\nRecommendations\nClassa\nLevelb\nIn patients with unexplained syncope and bifas-\ncicular block, a pacemaker is indicated in the\npresence of either a baseline HV of >_70 ms, sec-\nond- or third-degree intra- or infra-Hisian block\nduring incremental atrial pacing, or an abnormal\nresponse to pharmacological challenge.119,120\nI\nB\nPacing is indicated in patients with alternating\nBBB with or without symptoms.\nI\nC\nPacing may be considered in selected patients\nwith unexplained syncope and bifascicular block\nwithout EPS (elderly, frail patients, high-risk and/\nor recurrent syncope).213\nIIb\nB\nPacing is not recommended for asymptomatic\nBBB or bifascicular block.115,121,215\nIII\nB\nBBB\n=\nbundle\nbranch\nblock;\nEPS\n=\nelectrophysiology\nstudy;\nHV\n=\nHis\u0002ventricular interval.\naClass of recommendation.\nbLevel of evidence.\nESC 2021\n..........................................................................\nESC Guidelines\n29\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/35/3427/6358547 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n......................................................\n5.4 Pacing for reflex syncope\nPermanent pacemaker therapy may be effective if asystole is a domi-\nnant feature of reflex syncope.

Both\nstudies showed fewer syncope recurrences with closed-loop stimula-\ntion, both in the acute setting during repeated tilt testing233 and dur-\ning 18-month clinical follow-up.227 However, until a formal parallel\ntrial is performed, no recommendation can be given regarding the\nselection of the pacing mode (i.e. DDD with rate-drop response or\nDDD with closed-loop stimulation) and its programming.\n5.5 Pacing for suspected\n(undocumented) bradycardia\nIn patients with recurrent unexplained syncope or falls at the end of\nthe conventional work-up, ILR monitoring should be considered in\nan attempt to document a spontaneous relapse instead of embarking\non empiric cardiac pacing.62\n5.5.1\nRecurrent undiagnosed syncope\nIn patients with unexplained syncope at the end of a complete work-\nup and absence of any conduction disturbance, the lack of a rationale\nand the negative results of small studies234,235 give sufficient evidence\nof inefficacy of cardiac pacing.

In\npatients with tilt-induced vasovagal syncope, DDD was used mostly\nwith a rate-drop response feature that provides rapid DDD if the\ndevice detects a rapid decrease in heart rate. A comparison between\nDDD closed-loop stimulation and conventional DDD has been per-\nformed by means of a crossover design in two small studies. Both\nstudies showed fewer syncope recurrences with closed-loop stimula-\ntion, both in the acute setting during repeated tilt testing233 and dur-\ning 18-month clinical follow-up.227 However, until a formal parallel\ntrial is performed, no recommendation can be given regarding the\nselection of the pacing mode (i.e. DDD with rate-drop response or\nDDD with closed-loop stimulation) and its programming.\n5.5 Pacing for suspected\n(undocumented) bradycardia\nIn patients with recurrent unexplained syncope or falls at the end of\nthe conventional work-up, ILR monitoring should be considered in\nan attempt to document a spontaneous relapse instead of embarking\non empiric cardiac pacing.62\n5.5.1\nRecurrent undiagnosed syncope\nIn patients with unexplained syncope at the end of a complete work-\nup and absence of any conduction disturbance, the lack of a rationale\nand the negative results of small studies234,235 give sufficient evidence\nof inefficacy of cardiac pacing. Thus, cardiac pacing is not recom-\nmended until a diagnosis is made (Figure 8).\n5.5.2\nRecurrent falls\nBetween 15% and 20% of unexplained falls may be syncopal in nature,\npossibly bradyarrhythmic.

The prognosis of HF varies according to the\ndefined population. In contemporary clinical trials of HFrEF, 1-year\nmortality rates of \u00036% are seen, whereas in large registry-based sur-\nveys, 1-year mortality rates exceed 20% in patients recently hospital-\nized for HF, but are closer to 6% in those recruited with stable\noutpatient HF.243 The concept of CRT is based on the fact that in\npatients with HF and LV systolic dysfunction, high-grade intraventric-\nular conduction delays are frequently observed, with a prevalence of\nQRS duration >120 ms in 25\u000250% of patients and of LBBB in\n15\u000227% of cases. Moreover, in such patients, AV dyssynchrony is\nalso often present with prolonged PR on the surface ECG in up to\n52% of cases.244\u0002246 These electrical abnormalities may result in AV,\ninterventricular, and intra-LV mechanical dyssynchrony.247,248\nRecommendations for CRT are based on the results of the major\nRCTs of CRT, most of which have been restricted to the \u000360% of\nHFrEF patients who are in SR. CRT is recommended (in addition to\nguideline-directed medical therapy) in only defined subsets of the HF\npatient population, the majority being symptomatic HF patients in SR\nwith a reduced LVEF and a QRS duration >_130 ms.

A recent survey in the USA, which derived\na nationally representative estimate of the entire US population of\nhospitalized patients, found that over a 10-year period (2003\u00022012),\nthere were an estimated 378 247 CRT-D implantations, representing\n\u000340 000 per year, or roughly 135 per million per year.249 In Europe,\nprevious estimates have reported that \u0003400 patients per million\npopulation per year might be suitable for CRT. This was based on an\nestimated prevalence of 35% for LVEF <_35% in a representative HF\npopulation, of which 41% of patients were estimated to have a QRS\nduration >_120 ms. The change to a higher threshold of QRS duration\nof 130 ms will reduce these estimates modestly.250,251 In Sweden, a\nrecent survey of 12 807 HFrEF patients showed that 7% had received\nCRT and 69% had no indication for CRT, but 24% had an indication\nand had not received CRT.

Individualized positioning of\nthe LV lead is crucial in these patients.\nAn important recent notion is the possible role played by a pro-\nlonged PR in HF patients with non-LBBB. A few single-centre studies\nand two post-hoc analyses of large RCTs (COMPANION and\nMADIT-CRT) indicated a potential benefit of implanting CRT in this\npatient subgroup.244,279,280 In MADIT-CRT, the subgroup of non-\nLBBB patients who had a prolonged PR did benefit from CRT-D, with\na 73% reduction in the risk of HF or death and an 81% reduction in\nthe risk of all-cause mortality compared with ICD-only therapy.279 In\nnon LBBB patients with normal PR, CRT-D was associated with a\ntrend towards an increased risk of HF or death and a >2-fold higher\nmortality compared with ICD therapy, suggesting a bidirectional sig-\nnificant interaction. However, the data are too limited to give a\nrecommendation.279\nThe results of the MADIT-CRT, REVERSE, and RAFT trials suggest\nthat in patients with LBBB, there is likely to be potential benefit in all\npatients with LBBB regardless of QRS duration, and that no cut-off\npoint can be identified clearly to exclude patients who will not\nrespond according to the QRS duration.272,273,275 In contrast, any\nbenefit of CRT in patients with non-LBBB is evident mostly in those\nwith a QRS duration >_150 ms. Importantly, as shown in the MADIT-\nCRT long-term study and RAFT, the benefit in patients with QRS\n<150 ms appeared later during follow-up.265,273\nThe\nEchocardiography\nGuided\nCardiac\nResynchronization\nTherapy (Echo-CRT) trial suggested possible harm from CRT when\nbaseline echocardiographic mechanical dyssynchrony in patients with\nQRS duration <130 ms is used.264,281 Therefore, selection of CRT\npatients based solely on the use of cardiac imaging data is strongly dis-\ncouraged in patients with so-called ‘narrow’ QRS (i.e. <130 ms).\nIndividual patient data pooled from three CRT-D vs. ICD trials\nenrolling predominantly patients with NYHA class II HF showed that\nwomen are more likely to respond than men.282 In the US Food and\nDrug Administration meta-analysis of patient-level data, Zusterzeel et\nal.283 found that the main difference occurred in patients with LBBB\nand a QRS of 130\u0002149 ms. In this group, women had a 76% reduc-\ntion in HF or death [absolute CRT-D to ICD difference, 23% (HR\n0.24, 95% CI 0.11\u00020.53; P < 0.001)] and a 76% reduction in death\nalone [absolute difference 9% (HR 0.24, 95% CI 0.06\u00020.89; P =\n0.03)], whereas there was no significant benefit in men for HF or\ndeath [absolute difference 4% (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.60\u00021.21; P =\n0.38)] or death alone [absolute difference 2% (HR 0.86, 95% CI\n0.49\u00021.52; P = 0.60)]. A possible explanation for the greater benefit\nof CRT in women has been attributed to sex difference in LV size, as\nsex-specific differences in response disappear when QRS duration is\nnormalized to LV end-diastolic volume.284 Recently, computer mod-\nelling confirmed that sex differences in the LV size account for a sig-\nnificant proportion of the sex difference in QRS duration, and\nprovided a possible mechanistic explanation for the sex difference in\nCRT response.285,286 Simulations accounting for the smaller LV size\nin female CRT patients predict 9 - 13 ms lower QRS duration thresh-\nolds for females. As with other ECG parameters (e.g. duration of QT\nand corrected QT), it is conceivable that QRS duration also has to\nreflect sex difference.\nECG criteria of intraventricular conduction disturbance, LBBB, and\nnon-LBBB have not been consistently defined and reported in any of\nthe past CRT studies.287,288 Similarly, the modality of QRS measure-\nment (automatic or manual, and ECG recording machine) was not\nreported in CRT studies. However, the selection of ECG criteria\nappears to influence hard endpoints.287\u0002290 Similarly, ECG recording\nmodality and ECG manufacturer have been shown to possibly affect\nthe automatically measured QRS duration.\nFinally, CRT is considered in patients on optimal medical treatment\n(OMT), including beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme\ninhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers, and mineralocorticoid\nreceptor antagonists. However, a study raises the question of the\ntiming of CRT, because the efficacy of the medical treatment can be\nlimited in patients with LBBB, suggesting considering CRT sooner.291\nMoreover, whereas everyday clinical practice supports the use of\nsacubitril/valsartan, ivabradine, and sodium\u0002glucose co-transporter-\n2 inhibitors, it must be emphasized that in the landmark trials\ndocumenting the efficacy of these drugs, very few patients had an\nindication for CRT.

Individualized positioning of\nthe LV lead is crucial in these patients.\nAn important recent notion is the possible role played by a pro-\nlonged PR in HF patients with non-LBBB. A few single-centre studies\nand two post-hoc analyses of large RCTs (COMPANION and\nMADIT-CRT) indicated a potential benefit of implanting CRT in this\npatient subgroup.244,279,280 In MADIT-CRT, the subgroup of non-\nLBBB patients who had a prolonged PR did benefit from CRT-D, with\na 73% reduction in the risk of HF or death and an 81% reduction in\nthe risk of all-cause mortality compared with ICD-only therapy.279 In\nnon LBBB patients with normal PR, CRT-D was associated with a\ntrend towards an increased risk of HF or death and a >2-fold higher\nmortality compared with ICD therapy, suggesting a bidirectional sig-\nnificant interaction. However, the data are too limited to give a\nrecommendation.279\nThe results of the MADIT-CRT, REVERSE, and RAFT trials suggest\nthat in patients with LBBB, there is likely to be potential benefit in all\npatients with LBBB regardless of QRS duration, and that no cut-off\npoint can be identified clearly to exclude patients who will not\nrespond according to the QRS duration.272,273,275 In contrast, any\nbenefit of CRT in patients with non-LBBB is evident mostly in those\nwith a QRS duration >_150 ms. Importantly, as shown in the MADIT-\nCRT long-term study and RAFT, the benefit in patients with QRS\n<150 ms appeared later during follow-up.265,273\nThe\nEchocardiography\nGuided\nCardiac\nResynchronization\nTherapy (Echo-CRT) trial suggested possible harm from CRT when\nbaseline echocardiographic mechanical dyssynchrony in patients with\nQRS duration <130 ms is used.264,281 Therefore, selection of CRT\npatients based solely on the use of cardiac imaging data is strongly dis-\ncouraged in patients with so-called ‘narrow’ QRS (i.e. <130 ms).\nIndividual patient data pooled from three CRT-D vs. ICD trials\nenrolling predominantly patients with NYHA class II HF showed that\nwomen are more likely to respond than men.282 In the US Food and\nDrug Administration meta-analysis of patient-level data, Zusterzeel et\nal.283 found that the main difference occurred in patients with LBBB\nand a QRS of 130\u0002149 ms. In this group, women had a 76% reduc-\ntion in HF or death [absolute CRT-D to ICD difference, 23% (HR\n0.24, 95% CI 0.11\u00020.53; P < 0.001)] and a 76% reduction in death\nalone [absolute difference 9% (HR 0.24, 95% CI 0.06\u00020.89; P =\n0.03)], whereas there was no significant benefit in men for HF or\ndeath [absolute difference 4% (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.60\u00021.21; P =\n0.38)] or death alone [absolute difference 2% (HR 0.86, 95% CI\n0.49\u00021.52; P = 0.60)]. A possible explanation for the greater benefit\nof CRT in women has been attributed to sex difference in LV size, as\nsex-specific differences in response disappear when QRS duration is\nnormalized to LV end-diastolic volume.284 Recently, computer mod-\nelling confirmed that sex differences in the LV size account for a sig-\nnificant proportion of the sex difference in QRS duration, and\nprovided a possible mechanistic explanation for the sex difference in\nCRT response.285,286 Simulations accounting for the smaller LV size\nin female CRT patients predict 9 - 13 ms lower QRS duration thresh-\nolds for females. As with other ECG parameters (e.g. duration of QT\nand corrected QT), it is conceivable that QRS duration also has to\nreflect sex difference.\nECG criteria of intraventricular conduction disturbance, LBBB, and\nnon-LBBB have not been consistently defined and reported in any of\nthe past CRT studies.287,288 Similarly, the modality of QRS measure-\nment (automatic or manual, and ECG recording machine) was not\nreported in CRT studies. However, the selection of ECG criteria\nappears to influence hard endpoints.287\u0002290 Similarly, ECG recording\nmodality and ECG manufacturer have been shown to possibly affect\nthe automatically measured QRS duration.\nFinally, CRT is considered in patients on optimal medical treatment\n(OMT), including beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme\ninhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers, and mineralocorticoid\nreceptor antagonists. However, a study raises the question of the\ntiming of CRT, because the efficacy of the medical treatment can be\nlimited in patients with LBBB, suggesting considering CRT sooner.291\nMoreover, whereas everyday clinical practice supports the use of\nsacubitril/valsartan, ivabradine, and sodium\u0002glucose co-transporter-\n2 inhibitors, it must be emphasized that in the landmark trials\ndocumenting the efficacy of these drugs, very few patients had an\nindication for CRT. Thus, there are no strong data to support the\nmandatory use of these drugs before considering CRT.292\u0002295\nRecommendations for cardiac resynchronization ther-\napy in patients in sinus rhythm\nRecommendations\nClassa\nLevelb\nLBBB QRS morphology\nCRT is recommended for symptomatic patients\nwith HF in SR with LVEF <_35%, QRS duration\n>_150 ms, and LBBB QRS morphology despite\nOMT, in order to improve symptoms and reduce\nmorbidity and mortality.37,39,40,254\u0002266,283,284\nI\nA\nCRT should be considered for symptomatic\npatients with HF in SR with LVEF <_35%, QRS\nduration 130\u0002149 ms, and LBBB QRS morphol-\nogy despite OMT, in order to improve symp-\ntoms and reduce morbidity and\nmortality.37,39,40,254\u0002266,283,284\nIIa\nB\nNon-LBBB QRS morphology\nCRT should be considered for symptomatic\npatients with HF in SR with LVEF <_35%, QRS\nduration >_150 ms, and non-LBBB QRS morphol-\nogy despite OMT, in order to improve symp-\ntoms and reduce morbidity.37,39,40,254\u0002266,283,284\nIIa\nB\nCRT may be considered for symptomatic\npatients with HF in SR with LVEF <_35%, QRS\nduration 130\u0002149 ms, and non-LBBB QRS mor-\nphology despite OMT, in order to improve\nsymptoms and reduce morbidity.273\u0002278,281\nIIb\nB\nQRS duration\nCRT is not indicated in patients with HF and\nQRS duration <130 ms without an indication for\nRV pacing.264,282\nIII\nA\nCRT = cardiac resynchronization therapy; HF = heart failure; LBBB = left bundle\nbranch block; LVEF = left ventricular ejection fraction; OMT = optimal medical\ntherapy; SR = sinus rhythm.\naClass of recommendation.\nbLevel of evidence.\nESC 2021\n................................................................................................................\n34\nESC Guidelines\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/35/3427/6358547 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n.............................................................................................................................................................................\n6.3 Patients in atrial fibrillation\nThis section considers indications for CRT in patients with perma-\nnent AF or persistent AF unsuitable for AF ablation or after unsuc-\ncessful AF ablation. AF ablation has been reported to improve LVEF\nand reduce the HF hospitalization rate in selected patients. In particu-\nlar, AF ablation is recommended for reversing LV dysfunction in AF\npatients when tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy is highly prob-\nable, regardless of symptoms.296 Therefore, CRT should be consid-\nered in those patients with persistent AF and HFrEF when AF\nablation cannot be performed or is declined by the patient. With\nregard to indications for rate control therapy and in particular to AVJ\nablation, refer to the ESC Guidelines for the management of AF.296\n6.3.1\nPatients with atrial fibrillation and heart failure\nwho are candidates for cardiac resynchronization therapy\nA major determinant of the success of CRT is the effective delivery\nof biventricular pacing. A particular aspect of AF patients is that AF\nrhythm with fast ventricular rate and irregularity may interfere with\nadequate biventricular pacing delivery. AF may reduce the rate of\neffective biventricular capture by creating spontaneous, fusion, or\npseudo-fusion beats. A high rate of biventricular pacing is not reached\nin two-thirds of patients with persistent or permanent AF.297\nData from large registries show that AF patients undergoing CRT\nhave an increased risk of mortality even after adjusting for several\nclinical variables.297\u0002299 In most AF patients with intact AV conduc-\ntion, an adequate biventricular pacing delivery can be achieved only\nby means of AVJ ablation.300\u0002302 A substudy of the RAFT trial300 was\nunable to show benefit of CRT without AVJ ablation with regard to\nthe combined endpoint of death or hospitalization for HF; notably,\nonly 47% of the patients had a biventricular capture >90%. The deci-\nsion to perform AVJ ablation is still a matter of debate, but most stud-\nies have shown improvements in LV function, functional capacity,\nexercise capacity, and survival (with the same magnitude as in\npatients with SR).301 Gasparini et al.302 compared total mortality of\n443 AF patients who received AVJ ablation (n = 443) and of 895 AF\npatients who received rate-slowing drugs with the mortality of 6046\npatients who were in SR. The long-term survival after CRT among\npatients with AF and AVJ ablation was similar to that observed among\npatients in SR (HR 0.93); the mortality was higher for AF patients\ntreated with rate-slowing drugs (HR 1.52). The most common rate-\ncontrolling drugs used in AF are beta-blockers; although safe even in\nthe context of AF and HFrEF, they do not necessarily have the same\nbenefit as in patients with SR303 and the benefit\u0002risk ratio is influ-\nenced by other cardiovascular comorbidities.304,305 In a systematic\nreview and meta-analysis,306 AVJ ablation, compared with no AVJ\nablation, reduced mortality by 37% and reduced the rate of non-\nresponse by 59% in patients with biventricular pacing <90%, but\nshowed no benefit in those with >_90% biventricular pacing. Similarly,\nTolosana et al. observed the same rate of responders (defined as\n>_10% decrease in end-systolic volume) in AF patients who received\nAVJ ablation or rate-slowing drugs and patients in SR who had\nadequate biventricular pacing (97, 94, and 97%, respectively).307\nImportantly, AVJ ablation did not improve survival for patients in AF\ntreated with CRT compared with those treated with rate-slowing\ndrugs when an adequate biventricular pacing was achieved either\nwith ablation (97%) or with drugs (94%).308\nIn conclusion, despite the weak evidence due to lack of large,\nrandomized trials, the prevailing opinion of experts is in favour of the\nusefulness of CRT in patients with permanent AF and NYHA class III\nand IV with the same indications as for patients in SR, provided that\nAVJ ablation is added in those patients with incomplete (<90 - 95%)\nbiventricular capture due to AF (Figure 9). However, there are other\ncauses for incomplete biventricular pacing such as frequent prema-\nture ventricular beats, which may need to be treated (with drugs or\nablation) before considering AVJ ablation. Importantly, evaluation of\nthe biventricular pacing percentage is mainly given by the percentage\nof biventricular pacing using device memory, which does not reflect\nexactly the rate of effective biventricular capture. Holter monitoring\nmay help to assess the real biventricular capture percentage.309,310 A\nnew algorithm has been developed that can continuously assess the\neffective biventricular pacing.311\nFor patients with permanent AF, there are no data supporting the\ndifference in the magnitude of response to CRT according to the\nQRS morphology or a QRS duration cut-off of 150 ms.\nIt is important to remember that limited data are available for\npatients in NYHA class II.\n6.3.2\nPatients with uncontrolled heart rate who are\ncandidates for atrioventricular junction ablation\n(irrespective of QRS duration)\nAVJ ablation should be considered to control heart rate in patients\nunresponsive or intolerant to intensive rate and rhythm control ther-\napy, or who are ineligible for AF ablation, accepting that these\npatients will become pacemaker dependent.296 In particular, AVJ\nablation combined with CRT may be preferred to AF ablation in\nseverely symptomatic patients with permanent AF and at least one\nhospitalization for HF.296\nAVJ ablation and permanent pacing from the RV apex provides\nhighly efficient rate control and regularization of the ventricular\nresponse in AF, and improves symptoms in selected patients.192 A\nlarge study with a propensity score-matched control group194\nshowed a 53% reduction in total mortality in patients who underwent\nAVJ ablation compared with those treated with pharmacological rate\ncontrol therapy. A class IIa indication is provided in the 2020 ESC\nGuidelines on AF.296\nThe downside of RV pacing, however, is that it induces LV dyssyn-\nchrony in \u000350% of patients,312 and that this may lead to worsening of\nHF symptoms in a minority. In the majority of patients, AVJ ablation\nimproves LVEF even with RV apical (RVA) pacing due to amelioration\nof tachycardia-induced LV dysfunction, which commonly exists in\nthese patients. CRT may prevent RV pacing-induced LV dyssyn-\nchrony. The multicentre, randomized, prospective Ablate and Pace in\nAtrial Fibrillation (APAF) trial313 included 186 patients in whom a\nCRT or RV pacing device was implanted, followed by AVJ ablation.\nDuring a median follow-up of 20 months, CRT significantly reduced\nby 63% the primary composite endpoint of death due to HF, hospital-\nization due to HF, or worsening of HF. The beneficial effects of CRT\nwere similar in patients with an EF <_35%, NYHA class >_III, and QRS\nwidth >_120 ms, and in other patients with EF>35% or NYHA class\n< III or narrow QRS.

A high rate of biventricular pacing is not reached\nin two-thirds of patients with persistent or permanent AF.297\nData from large registries show that AF patients undergoing CRT\nhave an increased risk of mortality even after adjusting for several\nclinical variables.297\u0002299 In most AF patients with intact AV conduc-\ntion, an adequate biventricular pacing delivery can be achieved only\nby means of AVJ ablation.300\u0002302 A substudy of the RAFT trial300 was\nunable to show benefit of CRT without AVJ ablation with regard to\nthe combined endpoint of death or hospitalization for HF; notably,\nonly 47% of the patients had a biventricular capture >90%. The deci-\nsion to perform AVJ ablation is still a matter of debate, but most stud-\nies have shown improvements in LV function, functional capacity,\nexercise capacity, and survival (with the same magnitude as in\npatients with SR).301 Gasparini et al.302 compared total mortality of\n443 AF patients who received AVJ ablation (n = 443) and of 895 AF\npatients who received rate-slowing drugs with the mortality of 6046\npatients who were in SR. The long-term survival after CRT among\npatients with AF and AVJ ablation was similar to that observed among\npatients in SR (HR 0.93); the mortality was higher for AF patients\ntreated with rate-slowing drugs (HR 1.52). The most common rate-\ncontrolling drugs used in AF are beta-blockers; although safe even in\nthe context of AF and HFrEF, they do not necessarily have the same\nbenefit as in patients with SR303 and the benefit\u0002risk ratio is influ-\nenced by other cardiovascular comorbidities.304,305 In a systematic\nreview and meta-analysis,306 AVJ ablation, compared with no AVJ\nablation, reduced mortality by 37% and reduced the rate of non-\nresponse by 59% in patients with biventricular pacing <90%, but\nshowed no benefit in those with >_90% biventricular pacing.

Widespread adoption of this technique\nrelies upon further validation of its efficacy in large RCTs and\nimprovements in lead design, delivery tools, and devices (see\nsection 7).\n6.4 Patients with conventional\npacemaker or implantable cardioverter\ndefibrillator who need upgrade to\ncardiac resynchronization therapy\nSeveral studies have demonstrated the deleterious effect of chronic\nRV pacing with respect to an increased risk of HF symptoms or\nhospitalizations, which may be reduced by programming to maximize\nintrinsic conduction or prevented by CRT.148,183,190,324 Previously,\nthe benefit of CRT upgrade had been investigated only by observatio-\nnal controlled trials and registries,325\u0002339 mainly comparing upgrade\nwith de novo CRT; in early, small, observational pre- vs. post-CRT\nstudies;340\u0002346 and in crossover trials,347\u0002350 providing only limited\nclinical outcome data.\nBased on a recent meta-analysis of observational studies, mostly\nsingle-centre,351 echocardiographic and functional response as well\nas the risk of mortality or HF events was similar in patients after de\nnovo vs. upgrade CRT; however, in previous subgroup analyses from\nlarge, randomized, prospective trials such as RAFT,37 morbidity or\nmortality benefit was not confirmed.\nClinical outcomes are also influenced by the clinical characteristics\nof patients referred to CRT upgrade. Based on data from the\nEuropean CRT Survey II,352 a high-volume registry, and clinical char-\nacteristics from previous studies,351 patients referred for a CRT\nupgrade differ from patients referred for de novo CRT implantation:\nthey are older (even compared with those in RCTs), mainly male\npatients, and have more comorbidities such as AF, ischaemic heart\ndisease, anaemia, and renal failure.\nOn average, the number of upgrade procedures reaches 23% of\ntotal CRT implantations, 60% from a conventional device and 40%\nfrom an ICD352 in ESC countries, showing significant regional differ-\nences regarding the type of implanted device, such as CRT-P or\nCRT-D.352,353\nRegarding\nprocedure-related\ncomplications,\nseveral\nstudies\ndescribed a higher burden during upgrade procedures, ranging from\n6.8% to 20.9% compared with de novo implantations.339,354 This was\nnot confirmed in a recent analysis of registry data, where upgrades\nhad similar complication rates to de novo implantations.352 Notably,\n82% of these procedures were performed in high-volume centres.\nHowever, data on the long-term infection rates or lead revisions after\nCRT upgrade are scarce.354,355\nThe first prospective, randomized trial, the BUDAPEST CRT\nUpgrade study, is still ongoing, but may clarify these questions.356\nRecommendations for cardiac resynchronization\ntherapy in patients with persistent or permanent atrial\nﬁbrillation\nRecommendations\nClassa\nLevelb\n1) In patients with HF with permanent AF who are candidates\nfor CRT:\n1A) CRT should be considered for patients with\nHF and LVEF <_35% in NYHA class III or IV\ndespite OMT if they are in AF and have intrinsic\nQRS >_130 ms, provided a strategy to ensure\nbiventricular capture is in place, in order to\nimprove symptoms and reduce morbidity and\nmortality.302,306,307,322\nIIa\nC\n1B) AVJ ablation should be added in the case of\nincomplete biventricular pacing (<90\u000295%) due\nto conducted AF.297\u0002302\nIIa\nB\n2) In patients with symptomatic AF and an uncontrolled heart\nrate who are candidates for AVJ ablation (irrespective of QRS\nduration):\n2A) CRT is recommended in patients with\nHFrEF.196,197,306,308\nI\nB\n2B) CRT rather than standard RV pacing should\nbe considered in patients with HFmrEF.\nIIa\nC\n2C) RV pacing should be considered in patients\nwith HFpEF.188,196,323\nIIa\nB\n2D) CRT may be considered in patients with\nHFpEF.\nIIb\nC\nAF = atrial ﬁbrillation; AVJ = atrioventricular junction; CRT = cardiac resynchroniza-\ntion therapy; EF = ejection fraction; HF = heart failure; HFrEF = heart failure with\nreduced ejection fraction (<40%); HFmrEF = heart failure with mildly reduced ejection\nfraction (40- 49%); HFpEF = heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (>_50%)\naccording to the 2021 ESC HF Guidelines;242 LVEF = left ventricular ejection fraction;\nNYHA = New York Heart Association; RV = right ventricular.\naClass of recommendation.\nbLevel of evidence.\nRecommendation for upgrade from right ventricular\npacing to cardiac resynchronization therapy\nRecommendation\nClassa\nLevelb\nPatients who have received a conventional pace-\nmaker or an ICD and who subsequently develop\nsymptomatic HF with LVEF <_35% despite OMT,\nand who have a signiﬁcantc proportion of RV\npacing, should be considered for upgrade to\nCRT.37,148,185,190,324\u0002352\nIIa\nB\nCRT = cardiac resynchronization therapy; HF = heart failure; ICD = implantable\ncardioverter-deﬁbrillator; LVEF = left ventricular ejection fraction; OMT = opti-\nmal medical therapy; RV = right ventricular.\naClass of recommendation.\nbLevel of evidence.\ncA limit of 20% RV pacing for considering interventions for pacing-induced HF is\nsupported by observational data.

CRT response is high among\npatients with systolic dysfunction and expected frequent RV pacing.\nBased on the MOde Selection Trial in Sinus-Node Dysfunction\n(MOST),183 at least 40% RV pacing is associated with an increased\nrisk of HF hospitalization or AF.\nFor patients with normal or preserved EF, data on benefit of CRT\nare conflicting with respect to hospitalization, and no mortality bene-\nfit was shown.166,268,323,359 However, adverse remodelling caused by\nRV pacing was prevented by biventricular pacing, especially during\nlong-term follow up.323,359,360 A single-centre study showed that\n>20% RV pacing was associated with deleterious LV remodelling in\npatients with AVB and preserved LVEF.188 Frailty should also be\ntaken into account in deciding on CRT implantation, because of the\nhigher costs and high complication rates of this procedure.\n6.6 Benefit of adding implantable\ncardioverter defibrillator in patients with\nindications for cardiac resynchronization\ntherapy\nThe mortality benefit of CRT-D over CRT-P is still unclear, mostly\nbecause no head to head RCTs have been designed to compare\nthese two treatments. While CRT-D may further improve survival\nover CRT-P by reducing arrhythmic death, it does also add ICD-\nspecific risks such as lead failure and inappropriate shocks, as well as\ncosts.\nCOMPANION is the only trial to randomize patients to CRT-P or\nCRT-D, but was designed to assess the effects of CRT compared\nwith OMT.260 Crucially, it was not designed to compare CRT-D and\nCRT-P. CRT-P was associated with a marginally non-significant\nreduction in the risk of all-cause mortality (HR 0.76, 95% CI\n0.58 - 1.01; P = 0.06), whereas CRT-D was associated with a signifi-\ncant, 36% risk reduction (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.48\u00020.86; P = 0.004).\nAnalysis of cause-specific mortality showed that SCD was significantly\nreduced by CRT-D (HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.23 - 0.86; P = 0.02) but not\nCRT-P (HR 1.21, 95% CI 0.7\u00022.07; P = 0.50).363\nNevertheless, the CARE-HF extension study proved that CRT-P\nalone reduced the risk of dying suddenly by 5.6%.261 In line with these\nfindings, subgroup analyses from RCTs in mild HF consistently found\na reduction in ventricular arrhythmias with CRT.364\u0002368 These effects\nwere especially observed among CRT responders, suggesting that\nthe reduction in SCD risk is related to the extent of reverse LV\nremodelling with CRT.\nMeta-analyses have drawn different conclusions on the matter. In\nthe study by Al-Majed et al.,369 the survival benefit of CRT was largely\ndriven by a reduction in HF-related mortality, but SCD was not\nreduced. Lam et al.370 showed that CRT-D significantly reduced mor-\ntality compared with medical therapy alone [odds ratio (OR) 0.57,\n95% CI 0.40\u00020.80], but not when compared with ICD without CRT\n(OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.57\u00021.18) or CRT-P (OR 0.85, 95% CI\n0.60\u00021.22). However, more recently, a network meta-analysis of 13\nrandomized trials including >12 000 patients found that CRT-D\nreduced total mortality by 19% (95% CI 1\u000233%, unadjusted) com-\npared with CRT-P.275\nSome recent large observational studies highlighted the impor-\ntance of HF aetiology in the assessment of potential benefits of CRT-\nD over CRT-P.371\u0002373 CRT-D was associated with a significant risk\nreduction in all-cause mortality compared with CRT-P in patients\nwith ischaemic cardiomyopathy. However, this difference was not\nfound in patients with non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy.\nThese findings are consistent with the results from the DANISH\nstudy, which assigned 1116 patients with HF and non-ischaemic cardi-\nomyopathy to receive either a primary prophylactic ICD or usual\nclinical care alone.374 In both groups, 58% of patients also had CRT.\nSubgroup analysis showed that CRT-D was not superior to CRT-P in\nreducing the primary outcome of all-cause mortality (HR 0.91, 95%\nCI 0.64\u00021.29; P = 0.59) after a median follow-up of 67.6 months.\nHowever, in a large multicentre registry of >50 000 patients, CRT-D\nwas associated with a significantly lower observed mortality.375\nSimilar results were found in a recent propensity-matched cohort,\nwhere CRT-D was associated with a significantly lower all-cause\nmortality than CRT-P in patients with ischaemic aetiology and in\npatients with non-ischaemic HF under 75 years old.376 Furthermore,\nthe CeRtiTuDe Cohort study377 showed better survival in CRT-D\nvs. CRT-P mainly due to a reduction of non-SCD. In an Italian multi-\ncentre CRT registry, the only independent predictor of mortality was\nthe lack of an ICD.378 Whereas these studies are limited by their\nobservational design, important novel information on the issue of\nCRT-D vs. CRT-P is expected to come from an ongoing randomized\ntrial, Re-evaluation of Optimal Re-synchronisation Therapy in\nRecommendation for patients with heart failure and\natrioventricular block\nRecommendation\nClassa\nLevelb\nCRT rather than RV pacing is recommended for\npatients with HFrEF (<40%) regardless of NYHA\nclass who have an indication for ventricular pac-\ning and high-degree AVB in order to reduce\nmorbidity.

A recent observational study\nraised concern with regard to increasing HBP pacing thresholds with\nintermediate follow-up.426 The higher capture thresholds lead to\nshorter battery longevity (at 5 years there were 9% generator\nchanges with HBP compared with 1% with RVP).427 Capture thresh-\nolds of HBP at implantation should aim to be <2.0 V/1 ms (or <2.5 V/\n0.4 ms) and bipolar R-wave sensing amplitude >2.0 mV. With experi-\nence, thresholds decrease as implanters gain confidence to reposition\nleads. Sensing issues include not only ventricular undersensing, but\nalso oversensing of atrial or His potentials (which may be potentially\nlethal in a pacemaker-dependent patient).\nAn RV backup lead should be considered if the implanter is inex-\nperienced, or if there are high capture thresholds or sensing issues in\npacemaker-dependent patients, in those scheduled for AVN ablation\n(where there is a risk of compromising HBP), or in patients with high-\ndegree or infranodal block. Pros and cons are listed in Table 9.\nSeveral series have shown that the rate of mid-term lead revision\nis relatively high at \u00037%,318,423,427,428 (and reported to be as high as\n11%426), and is higher than RV pacing, which is 2\u00023%.427,429\nTherefore, it is advisable to follow-up these patients at least once\nevery 6 months or place them on remote monitoring (ensuring that\nautomatic threshold measurements correspond to those measured\nmanually, as this may not be the case and depends on device configu-\nration).430 Device programming should take into account specific\nrequirements for HBP, which are covered in detail elsewhere.431,432\n7.2.2\nIndications\n7.2.2.1 Pacing for bradycardia\nOne study reported that in patients with AVB and normal baseline\nLVEF, the incidence of RV pacing-induced cardiomyopathy was\n12.3% and the risk was increased if the percentage of ventricular pac-\ning was >_20% (HR 6.76; P = 0.002).188 However, there are no data to\nsupport that any percentage of RV pacing can be considered as defin-\ning a true limit below which RV pacing is safe and beyond which RV\npacing is harmful. Observational data indicate that patients with HBP\nfare better in terms of HF hospitalizations than patients with RV pac-\ning if the percentage of ventricular pacing is >20% (HR 0.54; P =\n0.01).42 Of note, the average baseline LVEF in patients with HBP in\nthat study was 55% and the average QRS duration was 105 ms. HBP\nmay therefore avoid clinical deterioration in these patients, particu-\nlarly if the intrinsic QRS is narrow or if BBB is corrected by HBP.\nIn a series of 100 patients with AVB undergoing HBP by experi-\nenced operators, implantation was successful in 41/54 (76%) patients\nwith infranodal AVB and higher in the case of nodal block (93%; P <\n0.05).433 Over a mean follow-up of 19 ± 12 months, lead revision\nwas necessary in 2/41 (5%) patients with infranodal block and in 3/43\n(7%) with nodal block. Notably, the average LVEF in this series was\n54%, and there are no data reported specifically on HBP in patients\nwith AVB and reduced LVEF. HBP is an option in patients with a nar-\nrow QRS or if HBP corrects BBB, but otherwise biventricular pacing\nis indicated.\nThere is a need for RCTs to compare the safety and efficacy of\nHBP with RV pacing. It is important to balance the potential benefits\nof HBP with the aforementioned issues of higher capture thresholds\nand shorter battery longevity, a higher rate of lead revision, and more\nfrequent sensing issues, compared with RV pacing. It is also important\nto consider the operator’s experience and expertise with HBP, and\nwhether a backup ventricular pacing lead is indicated. The patient’s\nsafety should be first and foremost in decision-making.\n7.2.2.2 Pace and ablate\nSeven observational series, totalling >240 patients treated with a\n‘pace-and-ablate’ strategy for rapidly conducted AF, found an\nimprovement in LVEF and NYHA class compared with baseline with\nHBP.197\u0002199,434 Long-term results with a median of 3 years of follow-\nup have been reported, with favourable outcomes.434 A single-\nblinded, randomized, crossover study in 16 patients compared HBP\nwith RVA pacing over 6 months and found better NYHA and 6-min\nwalk distance with HBP, without differences in echocardiographic\nparameters.200 However, only four patients in this study had con-\nfirmed HBP (with para-Hisian pacing in the remaining patients).\nThese studies included patients with reduced as well as preserved\nLVEF,197,198 and QRS width was on average <120 ms. HBP is of par-\nticular interest in patients with a normal baseline QRS morphology as\nit preserves intrinsic ventricular synchrony, However, a caveat is that\nAVJ ablation may result in an increase in HBP capture thresholds or\nin lead dislodgments in a minority of patients.197,199,318,426 Owing to\nthese issues and risk of HBP lead failure, a backup RV lead should be\nconsidered.\n7.2.2.3 Role in cardiac resynchronization therapy\nIn 1977, Narula showed that pacing of the His bundle can correct\nLBBB in a subset of patients, implying a proximal site of conduction\ndisturbance with longitudinal dissociation within the His bundle.435 A\nrecent mapping study reported intra-Hisian block in 46% of patients\nwith LBBB, in whom 94% were corrected by temporary HBP.436 HBP\nmay therefore be used in lieu of biventricular pacing for HBP-based\nCRT, as some data have shown that results are comparable (see\nSupplementary Table 10).437\u0002439 Nevertheless, especially in CRT can-\ndidates with LBBB, biventricular pacing has more solid evidence of\nefficacy and safety, and therefore remains first-line therapy.

In addition, implanting physicians\nshould have the same competency and accreditation as those\nrequired for standard transvenous pacing to be able to offer the most\nsuitable system for a given patient. Implantation of leadless pace-\nmakers should be performed in an adequate setting (i.e. with high-\nresolution multiplane fluoroscopy) and with cardiac surgery available\non site due to the risk of tamponade, which may be more difficult to\nmanage than with standard pacing.446,447\nLeadless pacemakers that only function in the VVI(R) mode\nrestrict indications to patients with AF or very infrequent pacing (e.g.\nparoxysmal AVB). Recently, VDD pacing (by detection of atrial con-\ntraction by the accelerometer) has been introduced, which extends\nindications to patients with AVB with preserved sinus node function.\nAV synchrony is maintained 70\u000290% of the time, depending on the\npatient’s position and activity, based on data from two studies includ-\ning 73 patients in SR and high-degree AV block.448 There may in\nfuture be an alternative to standard DDD pacemakers in selected\npatients if the potential benefits of leadless pacing outweigh the\npotential benefits of 100% AV synchrony, atrial pacing, and atrial\narrhythmia monitoring.\nIndications for leadless pacemakers include obstruction of the\nvenous route used for standard pacemaker implantation (e.g. bilateral\nvenous thoracic outlet syndrome or chronic obstruction of the supe-\nrior vena cava), pocket issues (e.g. in the case of cachexia or demen-\ntia), or particularly increased infection risk [e.g. in the case of dialysis\nRecommendations for using His bundle pacing\nRecommendations\nClassa\nLevelb\nIn patients treated with HBP, device program-\nming tailored to speciﬁc requirements of HBP is\nrecommended.430,431\nI\nC\nIn CRT candidates in whom coronary sinus lead\nimplantation is unsuccessful, HBP should be con-\nsidered as a treatment option along with other\ntechniques such as surgical epicardial\nlead.318,424,440,443\nIIa\nB\nIn patients treated with HBP, implantation of an\nRV lead used as ‘backup’ for pacing should be\nconsidered in speciﬁc situations (e.g. pacemaker\ndependency, high-grade AVB, infranodal block,\nhigh pacing threshold, planned AVJ ablation) or\nfor sensing in the case of issues with detection\n(e.g. risk of ventricular undersensing or over-\nsensing of atrial/His potentials).423,426,444\nIIa\nC\nHBP with a ventricular backup lead may be con-\nsidered in patients in whom a ‘pace-and-ablate’\nstrategy for rapidly conducted supraventricular\narrhythmia is indicated, particularly when the\nintrinsic QRS is narrow.197,199,200,318\nIIb\nC\nContinued\nHBP may be considered as an alternative to RV\npacing in patients with AVB and LVEF >40%,\nwho are anticipated to have >20% ventricular\npacing.42,433\nIIb\nC\nAVB = atrioventricular block; AVJ = atrioventricular junction; CRT = cardiac\nresynchronization therapy; HBP = His bundle pacing; LVEF = left ventricular ejec-\ntion fraction; RV = right ventricular.\naClass of recommendation.\nbLevel of evidence.\nESC 2021\n.................................\nESC Guidelines\n43\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/35/3427/6358547 by guest on 14 January 2026",

An interesting population is patients\nwith RBBB, who are known to respond less well to biventricular pac-\ning, in whom HBP has shown promising preliminary results in a series\nof 37 patients.441 HBP may sometimes incompletely correct BBB, and\ncan be used in conjunction with RV, LV, or biventricular pacing, as in\nthe HOT-CRT study.319 This is of particular interest in patients with\npermanent AF, in whom a His lead may be connected to the vacant\natrial port, thus offering additional therapeutic options.\n7.3 Left bundle branch area pacing\nWith left bundle branch area pacing, the lead is implanted slightly dis-\ntal to the His bundle and is screwed deep in the LV septum, ideally to\ncapture the left bundle branch.442 Advantages of this technique are\nthat electrical parameters are usually excellent, it may be successful\nin blocks that are too distal to be treated with HBP, and it also facili-\ntates AVJ ablation, which may be challenging with HBP. However,\nalthough the technique is very promising, data on this modality are\nstill scarce (Supplementary Table 11), and there is concern regarding\nlong-term lead performance and feasibility of lead extraction.\nRecommendations for using left bundle branch area pacing cannot\ntherefore be formulated at this stage. However, conduction system\npacing (which includes HBP and left bundle branch area pacing) is\nvery likely to play a growing role in the future, and the current rec-\nommendations will probably need to be revised once more solid evi-\ndence of safety and efficacy (from randomized trials) is published. A\ncomparison of RV pacing, HBP, and left bundle branch area pacing is\nprovided in Supplementary Table 12.\n7.4 Leadless pacing\nLeadless pacemakers have been developed to address limitations typ-\nically related to pulse generator pocket and transvenous leads of con-\nventional pacemaker systems. Currently, two leadless pacemaker\nsystems have been studied in clinical trials, of which one is currently\navailable for clinical use. Both are inserted into the RV cavity by a fem-\noral venous approach using a specially designed catheter-based deliv-\nery system.\nA number of prospective registries have reported that implanta-\ntion success rates are high, with adequate electrical results both at\nimplant and at follow-up (Supplementary Table 13). ‘Real-world’\nresults of one leadless pacemaker system, including 1817 patients,\nreported serious adverse events in 2.7% of patients.50 The prevalence\nof leadless device infections is low as the principal sources of infection\n(i.e. the subdermal surgical pocket and pacemaker leads) are absent.\nHowever, during the initial operator experience, there was a higher\nincidence of peri-operative major complications (6.5%), including\nperforation and tamponade, vascular complications, ventricular\narrhythmias, and death.445 These data highlight the importance of\nadequate training and supervision in this domain when starting with\nleadless pacemaker implantation. In addition, implanting physicians\nshould have the same competency and accreditation as those\nrequired for standard transvenous pacing to be able to offer the most\nsuitable system for a given patient. Implantation of leadless pace-\nmakers should be performed in an adequate setting (i.e. with high-\nresolution multiplane fluoroscopy) and with cardiac surgery available\non site due to the risk of tamponade, which may be more difficult to\nmanage than with standard pacing.446,447\nLeadless pacemakers that only function in the VVI(R) mode\nrestrict indications to patients with AF or very infrequent pacing (e.g.\nparoxysmal AVB). Recently, VDD pacing (by detection of atrial con-\ntraction by the accelerometer) has been introduced, which extends\nindications to patients with AVB with preserved sinus node function.\nAV synchrony is maintained 70\u000290% of the time, depending on the\npatient’s position and activity, based on data from two studies includ-\ning 73 patients in SR and high-degree AV block.448 There may in\nfuture be an alternative to standard DDD pacemakers in selected\npatients if the potential benefits of leadless pacing outweigh the\npotential benefits of 100% AV synchrony, atrial pacing, and atrial\narrhythmia monitoring.\nIndications for leadless pacemakers include obstruction of the\nvenous route used for standard pacemaker implantation (e.g. bilateral\nvenous thoracic outlet syndrome or chronic obstruction of the supe-\nrior vena cava), pocket issues (e.g. in the case of cachexia or demen-\ntia), or particularly increased infection risk [e.g. in the case of dialysis\nRecommendations for using His bundle pacing\nRecommendations\nClassa\nLevelb\nIn patients treated with HBP, device program-\nming tailored to speciﬁc requirements of HBP is\nrecommended.430,431\nI\nC\nIn CRT candidates in whom coronary sinus lead\nimplantation is unsuccessful, HBP should be con-\nsidered as a treatment option along with other\ntechniques such as surgical epicardial\nlead.318,424,440,443\nIIa\nB\nIn patients treated with HBP, implantation of an\nRV lead used as ‘backup’ for pacing should be\nconsidered in speciﬁc situations (e.g. pacemaker\ndependency, high-grade AVB, infranodal block,\nhigh pacing threshold, planned AVJ ablation) or\nfor sensing in the case of issues with detection\n(e.g. risk of ventricular undersensing or over-\nsensing of atrial/His potentials).423,426,444\nIIa\nC\nHBP with a ventricular backup lead may be con-\nsidered in patients in whom a ‘pace-and-ablate’\nstrategy for rapidly conducted supraventricular\narrhythmia is indicated, particularly when the\nintrinsic QRS is narrow.197,199,200,318\nIIb\nC\nContinued\nHBP may be considered as an alternative to RV\npacing in patients with AVB and LVEF >40%,\nwho are anticipated to have >20% ventricular\npacing.42,433\nIIb\nC\nAVB = atrioventricular block; AVJ = atrioventricular junction; CRT = cardiac\nresynchronization therapy; HBP = His bundle pacing; LVEF = left ventricular ejec-\ntion fraction; RV = right ventricular.\naClass of recommendation.\nbLevel of evidence.\nESC 2021\n.................................\nESC Guidelines\n43\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/35/3427/6358547 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n................................................................................\nor previous cardiovascular implantable electronic device (CIED)\ninfection].

Conditions favouring consideration of earlier pacemaker\nimplantation include unsuccessful or late revascularization, anterior\nMI, bifascicular block or AV block before MI, and progression of AV\nblock within the first days after MI.

The right coronary artery supplies\nthe sinus node in 60% and the AVN and His bundle in 90%\nof patients.451,452 AVB is located above the His bundle in most\npatients with inferior infarction, but is usually infra-Hisian and pre-\nceded by intraventricular conduction disturbances in anterior\ninfarction.451,453\u0002457\nThe incidence of high-degree AVB in patients with ST-segment ele-\nvation MI has declined to 3\u00024% in the primary percutaneous coro-\nnary intervention era.458\u0002460 High-degree AVB is most frequent in\ninferior or inferolateral infarctions.455,458\u0002461\nPatients with high-degree AVB have higher clinical risk and\nlarger infarctions especially when AVB complicates an anterior\ninfarction.458\u0002460,462,463 New-onset intraventricular conduction dis-\nturbance is also associated with larger infarctions.464\u0002467\nSinus bradycardia and AVB at presentation can be vagally me-\ndiated and may respond to atropine.455,468 Revascularization is\nrecommended in patients with AVB who have not yet received\nreperfusion therapy.469 AVB may require temporary pacing in the\npresence of refractory symptoms or haemodynamic compromise,\nbut most often resolves spontaneously within a few days and only a\nminority of patients require permanent pacing.451,454,456,458,462 In\npatients with persistent intraventricular conduction abnormalities\nand transient AVB in whom permanent pacing was recommended in\nthe past, there is no evidence that permanent cardiac pacing\nimproves outcome.454,470 These patients frequently have HF and\npoor LV function, and should be evaluated for ICD, CRT-P, or CRT-\nD rather than conventional pacing if an early device implantation is\nconsidered.471\nIf AVB does not resolve within 10 days, a permanent pacemaker\nshould be implanted. In the absence of robust scientific data, the wait-\ning period before pacemaker implantation has to be decided individu-\nally. It may last up to 10 days but can be shortened to 5 days\ndepending on the occluded vessel, time delay, and success of revascu-\nlarization. Conditions favouring consideration of earlier pacemaker\nimplantation include unsuccessful or late revascularization, anterior\nMI, bifascicular block or AV block before MI, and progression of AV\nblock within the first days after MI. Sick sinus syndrome after occlu-\nsion of the right coronary artery resolves in most cases. If revasculari-\nzation is incomplete, pacemaker implantation can usually still be\npostponed and implantation only be performed if symptoms due to\nsinus bradycardia persist.\n8.2 Pacing after cardiac surgery and\nheart transplantation\n8.2.1\nPacing after coronary artery bypass graft and\nvalve surgery\nAVB may occur in 1\u00024% of cases after cardiac surgery and in\n\u00038% after repeat valve surgery.472\u0002476 SND may occur after right\nlateral atriotomy or transseptal superior approaches to the mitral\nvalve.473,474\nRecommendations for using leadless pacing (leadless\npacemaker)\nRecommendations\nClassa\nLevelb\nLeadless pacemakers should be considered as an\nalternative to transvenous pacemakers when no\nupper extremity venous access exists or when\nrisk of device pocket infection is particularly\nhigh, such as previous infection and patients on\nhaemodialysis.45,47\u000250,450\nIIa\nB\nLeadless pacemakers may be considered as an\nalternative to standard single-lead ventricular\npacing, taking into consideration life expectancy\nand using shared decision-making.45,47\u000250\nIIb\nC\naClass of recommendation.\nbLevel of evidence.\nESC 2021\nRecommendations for cardiac pacing after acute myo-\ncardial infarction\nRecommendations\nClassa\nLevelb\nImplantation of a permanent pacemaker is indi-\ncated with the same recommendations as in a\ngeneral population (section 5.2) when AVB does\nnot resolve within a waiting period of at least 5\ndays after MI.\nI\nC\nIn selected patients with AVB in the context of\nanterior wall MI and acute HF, early device\nimplantation (CRT-D/CRT-P) may be\nconsidered.471\nIIb\nC\nPacing is not recommended if AVB resolves after\nrevascularization or spontaneously.454\u0002456,458\nIII\nB\nAVB = atrioventricular block; CRT-D = deﬁbrillator with cardiac resynchroniza-\ntion therapy; CRT-P = cardiac resynchronization therapy-pacemaker; MI = myo-\ncardial infarction.\naClass of recommendation.\nbLevel of evidence.\nESC 2021\n..........................................................................................\n44\nESC Guidelines\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/35/3427/6358547 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n........................................................................................................................................................\nPacemaker implantation is more frequent after valvular than after\ncoronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.477 In clinical practice,\nan observation period of 3\u00027 days is usually applied before implant-\ning a permanent pacemaker473 to allow regression of transient brady-\ncardias. The ideal timing of pacemaker implantation after cardiac\nsurgery remains a topic of controversy, due to the fact that 60\u000270%\nof patients implanted for SND and up to 25% of those implanted for\nAVB are not pacemaker dependent at follow-up.473,478 In the case of\ncomplete AVB occurring within the first 24 h after valvular surgery\nand persisting for 48 h, resolution within the next 1\u00022 weeks is\nunlikely and earlier implantation of a pacemaker may be consid-\nered.479,480 The same approach appears reasonable for complete\nAVB with a low rate of escape rhythm.473 The situation in CHD sur-\ngery and in children may be different (see section 8.4).\nIn valvular endocarditis, predictors of AVB after surgery are pre-\noperative conduction abnormalities, Staphylococcus aureus infection,\nintracardiac abscess, tricuspid valve involvement, and previous valvu-\nlar surgery.481 In patients with endocarditis and peri-operative AVB,\nearly pacemaker implantation is reasonable, especially when one or\nmore predicting factors are present. In light of the infected state of\nthe patient, intra-operative implantation of an epicardial pacemaker\nsystem during valvular surgery may be reasonable despite the\nabsence of solid data on infection rates of epicardial vs. transvenous\npacemaker systems.\n8.2.2\nPacing after heart transplantation\nSND is common and leads to permanent pacemaker implantation\nafter heart transplantation in 8% of patients.473 Possible causes of\nSND include surgical trauma, sinus node artery damage, or ischaemia\nand prolonged cardiac ischaemic times.482,483 AVB is less common,\nand is probably related to inadequate preservation of the donor\nheart.473,483,484 Chronotropic incompetence is always present fol-\nlowing standard orthotopic heart transplantation, as a result of loss\nof autonomic control. As sinus node and AVN function improve dur-\ning the first few weeks after transplantation, an observation period\nbefore pacemaker implantation may allow spontaneous improve-\nment of bradycardia.485 There is general consensus that patients in\nwhom symptomatic bradycardia persists after the third post-\noperative week may require permanent pacemaker implantation.\nDDD(R) mode with minimized ventricular pacing in the case of intact\nAVN conduction is recommended.483\n8.2.3\nPacing after tricuspid valve surgery\nAn underestimated aspect of the surgical management of tricuspid\nvalve disease is to address trans-tricuspid pacemaker or ICD leads.\nSuch leads can interfere with the function of a repaired tricuspid valve\nor tricuspid valve prosthesis.\nPlacing an epicardial RV lead at the time of tricuspid valve surgery\nis the most straightforward alternative in cases with type II second-\nor third-degree AVB. There have been doubts about the long-term\nperformance of epicardial leads, but recent data indicate, at least for\nepicardial LV leads, performance comparable with transvenous\nleads.486\nVentricular pacing after mechanical tricuspid valve replacement\nusing a coronary sinus lead appears safe and feasible, but only results\nfrom small patient cohorts have been published. Procedural success\nof implantation was 100% in 23 patients; after 5.3 ± 2.8 years, 96% of\nleads were functional with stable pacing and sensing parameters.487\nHBP is emerging as a more physiological method of ventricular\npacing and may evolve into a possible solution in patients with AV\nconduction disease after tricuspid valve surgery. One study investi-\ngating 30 patients with HBP after cardiac valve operations reported\nsuccessful permanent HBP in 93% of these patients.488 This study\nincluded 10 patients with tricuspid valve annuloplasty.\nAfter replacement by a mechanical valve, transvalvular lead\nplacement is contraindicated, and implanting either a coronary\nsinus lead for ventricular pacing or epicardial leads, which may be\nplaced minimally invasively, is recommended. To avoid damaging a\nrepaired tricuspid valve or a tricuspid bioprosthesis, the optimal\nsolution in patients needing ventricular pacing after such surgery\nshould not include transvalvular lead implantation. Implanting a cor-\nonary sinus lead for ventricular pacing or minimally invasively\nplaced epicardial leads is judged to be the preferred choice.\nHowever, as indicated in observational reports, transvalvular lead\nimplantation was used with acceptable results,489 and still may be\nconsidered in selected patients after tricuspid valve annuloplasty,\nother types of repair, and replacement of a tricuspid valve by a\nbioprosthesis.\nPerforming tricuspid valve replacement in a patient with an exist-\ning RV lead, removal of the old RV lead and implantation of an epi-\ncardial RV lead should be preferred over sewing in the existing lead\nbetween a bioprosthesis and annulus. The reasons are that sewing\nin the lead may be associated with higher risk of lead failure and, in\nthe case of future need for lead extraction, such a procedure is\nlikely to require open heart surgery, which will be a reintervention\nwith higher operative risk. In cases of tricuspid valve repair with a\ncurrent annuloplasty ring with an open segment and without con-\ncomitant leaflet procedures, an existing RV lead may be left in place\nwithout sewing it in between the ring and the annulus. However, even\nin isolated annuloplasty procedures, an existing RV lead should\nideally be removed to avoid future lead-related complications to\nthe repaired tricuspid valve and an epicardial RV lead should be\nimplanted. Particularly in patients not in need of a dual-chamber\ndevice, the use of a leadless pacemaker for ventricular pacing may\nserve as a feasible future alternative after tricuspid valve repair or\nreplacement by a bioprosthesis. However, experience is very lim-\nited, and no long-term data are available in this cohort.

There is currently no evidence to support per-\nmanent pacemaker implantation as a ‘prophylactic’ measure before\nTAVI in asymptomatic patients or in patients who do not meet the\nstandard indications for pacemaker implantation.\nA recommended approach for the management of conduction\nabnormalities after TAVI is detailed in Figure 12. Patients without new\nconduction disturbances post-TAVI are at very low risk of developing\nhigh-degree AVB.533\u0002535 Conversely, management of patients with\npersistent complete or high-degree AVB should follow standard\nguidelines. Permanent pacemaker implantation appears warranted in\npatients with intraprocedural AVB that persists for 24- 48 h after\nTAVI or appears later. Data to guide the management of patients\nwith other conduction abnormalities at baseline or post-procedure\nare more limited.\nGiven the close anatomical proximity of the aortic valve and the\nleft bundle branch, the most frequent conduction abnormality after\nTAVI is new-onset LBBB.504,536\u0002538 Only a small minority of these\npatients require pacemaker implantation.536,537 Thus, EPS539\u0002541 or\nlong-term monitoring536 in lieu of pacemaker implantation may be\nconsidered542,543 (see section 8 in the Supplementary data).

There is currently no evidence to support per-\nmanent pacemaker implantation as a ‘prophylactic’ measure before\nTAVI in asymptomatic patients or in patients who do not meet the\nstandard indications for pacemaker implantation.\nA recommended approach for the management of conduction\nabnormalities after TAVI is detailed in Figure 12. Patients without new\nconduction disturbances post-TAVI are at very low risk of developing\nhigh-degree AVB.533\u0002535 Conversely, management of patients with\npersistent complete or high-degree AVB should follow standard\nguidelines. Permanent pacemaker implantation appears warranted in\npatients with intraprocedural AVB that persists for 24- 48 h after\nTAVI or appears later. Data to guide the management of patients\nwith other conduction abnormalities at baseline or post-procedure\nare more limited.\nGiven the close anatomical proximity of the aortic valve and the\nleft bundle branch, the most frequent conduction abnormality after\nTAVI is new-onset LBBB.504,536\u0002538 Only a small minority of these\npatients require pacemaker implantation.536,537 Thus, EPS539\u0002541 or\nlong-term monitoring536 in lieu of pacemaker implantation may be\nconsidered542,543 (see section 8 in the Supplementary data). Several\nhigh-risk subgroups of patients with new LBBB have been identified\n(see Figure 12, and section 8 in the Supplementary data). In such\npatients with dynamic progression of conduction abnormalities after\nTAVI (new BBB with dynamic prolongation of QRS and/or PR), an\nextended monitoring period in hospital of up to 5 days should be\nconsidered.

Given the low rates of long-\nterm dependency on pacing,544,545 algorithms promoting spontane-\nous AV conduction should be used.\n8.4. Cardiac pacing and cardiac\nresynchronization therapy in congenital\nheart disease\nPermanent pacing in patients with moderate or complex CHD\nshould be performed in centres with a multidisciplinary team and\nexpertise in CHD-related device therapy. Generally, decision-making\nfor pacemaker therapy in patients with CHD is based on expert con-\nsensus and individual evaluation due to lack of evidence from RCTs.\nIn the presence of an intracardiac shunt between the systemic and\npulmonary circulation, endovascular lead placement is relatively con-\ntraindicated due to the risk of arterial embolism.551\nThe clinical presentation may vary considerably; even severe bra-\ndycardia in congenital AVB may remain oligosymptomatic or asymp-\ntomatic. Periodic Holter recordings may be useful for patients at\nspecific risk of bradyarrhythmia.\n8.4.1\nSinus node dysfunction and\nbradycardia\u0002tachycardia syndrome\nThere is no evidence that SND directly leads to increased mortality\nin CHD.

Given the low rates of long-\nterm dependency on pacing,544,545 algorithms promoting spontane-\nous AV conduction should be used.\n8.4. Cardiac pacing and cardiac\nresynchronization therapy in congenital\nheart disease\nPermanent pacing in patients with moderate or complex CHD\nshould be performed in centres with a multidisciplinary team and\nexpertise in CHD-related device therapy. Generally, decision-making\nfor pacemaker therapy in patients with CHD is based on expert con-\nsensus and individual evaluation due to lack of evidence from RCTs.\nIn the presence of an intracardiac shunt between the systemic and\npulmonary circulation, endovascular lead placement is relatively con-\ntraindicated due to the risk of arterial embolism.551\nThe clinical presentation may vary considerably; even severe bra-\ndycardia in congenital AVB may remain oligosymptomatic or asymp-\ntomatic. Periodic Holter recordings may be useful for patients at\nspecific risk of bradyarrhythmia.\n8.4.1\nSinus node dysfunction and\nbradycardia\u0002tachycardia syndrome\nThere is no evidence that SND directly leads to increased mortality\nin CHD. However, it may be associated with a higher rate of post-\noperative atrial flutter, with 1:1 AV conduction in CHD, and thus lead\nto morbidity and potentially mortality.552,553\n8.4.1.1 Indications for pacemaker implantation\nIn patients with symptomatic chronotropic incompetence, pace-\nmaker implantation is justified when other causes (see section 4) have\nbeen ruled out.554,555 Increasing the heart rate through permanent\npacing to prevent atrial arrhythmias may be considered.556 The\nunderlying evidence is weak, as the benefit of atrial-based pacing\nobserved in patients without structural heart disease could not be\nvalidated in CHD.21,557,558 The general consensus is that if permanent\npacing is necessary, single-lead atrial-based pacing should be pre-\nferred to limit the number of leads, especially in young patients with\nadequate AV conduction.559 In patients with congenitally corrected\ntransposition of the great arteries requiring ventricular pacing\nbecause of high-degree AVB, CRT should be considered. Current\nevidence to use devices with atrial antitachycardia pacing to treat\nintra-atrial re-entrant tachycardias in patients with CHD560,561 is too\nlimited to make general recommendations.\n8.4.2\nCongenital atrioventricular block\nA number of maternal or fetal factors can cause congenital heart\nblock, particularly autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus eryth-\nematosus and Sjo¨gren syndrome (Supplementary Table 16).\nPatients presenting with congenital AVB may be asymptomatic or\nmay present with reduced exercise capacity, syncopal attacks, con-\ngestive HF, ventricular dysfunction, and dilatation. Rarely, in SCD,\ncongenital AVB is diagnosed as the cause.562,563 SCD may occur\nthrough increased propensity to develop bradycardia-related ventric-\nular arrhythmias such as torsades-de-pointes.\n8.4.2.1 Indications for pacemaker implantation\nThere is general consensus that prophylactic pacing is indicated in\nasymptomatic patients with any of the following risk factors: mean\ndaytime heart rate <50 b.p.m., pauses greater than three times\nthe cycle length of the ventricular escape rhythm, a broad QRS\nescape rhythm, prolonged QT interval, or complex ventricular\nectopy.564\u0002566 Clinical symptoms, such as syncope, pre-syncope, HF,\nor chronotropic incompetence, are indications for pacemaker\nimplantation.564,567,568 If ventricular dysfunction is attributed to hae-\nmodynamic compromise caused by bradycardia, permanent pacing\nmay be indicated.518,567 Despite a modest quality of evidence, there\nRecommendations for cardiac pacing after transcath-\neter aortic valve implantation\nRecommendations\nClassa\nLevelb\nPermanent pacing is recommended in patients\nwith complete or high-degree AVB that persists\nfor 24 - 48 h after TAVI.546\nI\nB\nPermanent pacing is recommended in patients\nwith new-onset alternating BBB after\nTAVI.533,547\nI\nC\nEarlyc permanent pacing should be considered in\npatients with pre-existing RBBB who develop\nany further conduction disturbance during or\nafter TAVI.d\nIIa\nB\nAmbulatory ECG monitoringe or EPSf should be\nconsidered for patients with new LBBB with\nQRS >150 ms or PR >240 ms with no further\nprolongation during the >48 h after\nTAVI.536,537,548\nIIa\nC\nAmbulatory ECG monitoringe or EPSf may be\nconsidered for patients with a pre-existing con-\nduction abnormality who develop prolongation\nof QRS or PR >20 ms.g\nIIb\nC\nProphylactic permanent pacemaker implantation\nis not indicated before TAVI in patients with\nRBBB and no indication for permanent pacing.\nIII\nC\nAF = atrial ﬁbrillation; AVB = atrioventricular block; BBB = bundle branch block;\nCRT = cardiac resynchronization therapy; ECG = electrocardiogram; EPS = elec-\ntrophysiology study; HV = His\u0002ventricular interval; LBBB = left bundle branch\nblock; RBBB = right bundle branch block; SR = sinus rhythm; TAVI = transcath-\neter aortic valve implantation.

Implantation of epicardial leads should be consid-\nered during surgery in patients with complex CHD and a high lifetime\nrisk of pacemaker implantation, in order to reduce the rate of\nreoperation.\n8.4.4\nCardiac resynchronization\nStandard indications for CRT may be considered in CHD, taking into\naccount that the anatomy, morphology of the systemic ventricle, and\ncause of dyssynchrony, as well as QRS morphology, may be atypi-\ncal.574 Multidisciplinary teams in experienced centres should be\ninvolved in the decision-making process.\n8.5 Pacing in hypertrophic\ncardiomyopathy\n8.5.1\nBradyarrhythmia\nAVB in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) should generally be\ntreated according to the recommendations in this guideline (see sec-\ntion 5.2).

Around\n5\u000210% of dilated cardiomyopathies are induced by LMNA gene\nmutations, manifested as cardiac conduction disease, tachyarrhyth-\nmias, or impaired myocardial contractility.596,606\u0002620 SND and con-\nduction disease are frequently the first manifestation, in many cases\nwith preserved LV size and function.613,614 LMNA-related cardiomy-\nopathy is more malignant than most other cardiomyopathies, carry-\ning a higher risk of SCD in asymptomatic mutation carriers with\npreserved\nor\nonly\nmildly\ndecreased\nLV\ncontractility.610\u0002615\nPacemaker implantation does not reduce the risk of SCD in these\npatients. A meta-analysis of mode of death in LMNA mutations dem-\nonstrated that 46% of patients who died suddenly had an implanted\npacemaker. Sudden death rates were similar in those with isolated\ncardiomyopathy and those with an additional neuromuscular pheno-\ntype.611 Complex ventricular arrhythmias are common in patients\nwith conduction disturbances.612,613,615 In two studies, patients with\nLMNA mutations and an indication for permanent pacing underwent\nICD implantation, and appropriate ICD therapies occurred in 42%\nand 52% of patients within 3 and 5 years, respectively.612,613 These\nfindings led to the clinical practice to consider ICD rather than pace-\nmaker implantation in LMNA-related conduction disease.614,620 For\nadditional clinical risk factors for ventricular tachyarrhythmias and\nsudden death found in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy due to\nLMNA gene mutations, see Supplementary Table 18. CRT(D) should\nbe considered if the patient has AVB and LVEF <50%, and a high fre-\nquency of ventricular pacing is expected (section 6 and Supplementary\nTable 18). The risk score of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia in\nlaminopathies can be predicted by a recently developed and validated\nmodule (https://lmna-risk-vta.fr/).616\n8.6.4\nMitochondrial cytopathies\nMitochondrial cytopathies are a heterogeneous group of hereditary\ndisorders, in which cardiomyopathies, conduction defects, and ven-\ntricular\narrhythmias\nare\nthe\nmost\ncommon\ncardiac\npresentations.621,622 In Kearns\u0002Sayre syndrome, the most common\ncardiac manifestation is conduction disease, which may progress to\ncomplete AVB and cause SCD.623\u0002625\n8.6.5\nInfiltrative and metabolic diseases\nInfiltrative cardiomyopathy is secondary to abnormal deposition and\naccumulation of pathological products in the myocardial interstitium,\nwhile storage diseases lead to their intracellular accumulation. The\nmain cause of infiltrative cardiomyopathy is amyloidosis, while stor-\nage diseases include haemochromatosis, Fabry’s disease, and glycogen\nstorage diseases. In patients with cardiac amyloid, conduction defects,\ntachyarrhythmias, and SCD are common. Based upon current knowl-\nedge, conventional indications should be used for pacing in this group\nof patients.\n8.6.6\nInflammatory diseases\nInfections (viral, bacterial including Borreliosis, protozoa, fungal, para-\nsites), autoimmune (e.g. giant cell myocarditis, sarcoidosis, rheumatic\nheart disease, connective tissue disease, eosinophilic myocarditis),\ntoxic (alcohol, cocaine, cancer therapies, especially monoclonal anti-\nbodies), and physical reactions (radiation therapy) can cause inflam-\nmatory heart disease. Involvement of the AVN and the conduction\nsystem is more frequent than that of the sinus node. AVB may indi-\ncate involvement of the septum in the inflammatory process and is a\npredictor of adverse outcome. Ventricular arrhythmias may also\noccur because of myocardial pathology.\nWhen inflammatory heart disease is complicated by bradycardia,\nespecially AVB, specific therapy should be applied if available, eventu-\nally backed-up by temporary pacing or intravenous administration of\nisoprenaline. Otherwise, immunosuppressive therapy or awaiting\nspontaneous resolution may be sufficient. If bradycardia does not\nresolve within a clinically reasonable period or cannot be expected\nto resolve (e.g. after radiation therapy), permanent pacing is indi-\ncated.

Sudden death rates were similar in those with isolated\ncardiomyopathy and those with an additional neuromuscular pheno-\ntype.611 Complex ventricular arrhythmias are common in patients\nwith conduction disturbances.612,613,615 In two studies, patients with\nLMNA mutations and an indication for permanent pacing underwent\nICD implantation, and appropriate ICD therapies occurred in 42%\nand 52% of patients within 3 and 5 years, respectively.612,613 These\nfindings led to the clinical practice to consider ICD rather than pace-\nmaker implantation in LMNA-related conduction disease.614,620 For\nadditional clinical risk factors for ventricular tachyarrhythmias and\nsudden death found in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy due to\nLMNA gene mutations, see Supplementary Table 18. CRT(D) should\nbe considered if the patient has AVB and LVEF <50%, and a high fre-\nquency of ventricular pacing is expected (section 6 and Supplementary\nTable 18). The risk score of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia in\nlaminopathies can be predicted by a recently developed and validated\nmodule (https://lmna-risk-vta.fr/).616\n8.6.4\nMitochondrial cytopathies\nMitochondrial cytopathies are a heterogeneous group of hereditary\ndisorders, in which cardiomyopathies, conduction defects, and ven-\ntricular\narrhythmias\nare\nthe\nmost\ncommon\ncardiac\npresentations.621,622 In Kearns\u0002Sayre syndrome, the most common\ncardiac manifestation is conduction disease, which may progress to\ncomplete AVB and cause SCD.623\u0002625\n8.6.5\nInfiltrative and metabolic diseases\nInfiltrative cardiomyopathy is secondary to abnormal deposition and\naccumulation of pathological products in the myocardial interstitium,\nwhile storage diseases lead to their intracellular accumulation. The\nmain cause of infiltrative cardiomyopathy is amyloidosis, while stor-\nage diseases include haemochromatosis, Fabry’s disease, and glycogen\nstorage diseases. In patients with cardiac amyloid, conduction defects,\ntachyarrhythmias, and SCD are common. Based upon current knowl-\nedge, conventional indications should be used for pacing in this group\nof patients.\n8.6.6\nInflammatory diseases\nInfections (viral, bacterial including Borreliosis, protozoa, fungal, para-\nsites), autoimmune (e.g. giant cell myocarditis, sarcoidosis, rheumatic\nheart disease, connective tissue disease, eosinophilic myocarditis),\ntoxic (alcohol, cocaine, cancer therapies, especially monoclonal anti-\nbodies), and physical reactions (radiation therapy) can cause inflam-\nmatory heart disease. Involvement of the AVN and the conduction\nsystem is more frequent than that of the sinus node. AVB may indi-\ncate involvement of the septum in the inflammatory process and is a\npredictor of adverse outcome. Ventricular arrhythmias may also\noccur because of myocardial pathology.\nWhen inflammatory heart disease is complicated by bradycardia,\nespecially AVB, specific therapy should be applied if available, eventu-\nally backed-up by temporary pacing or intravenous administration of\nisoprenaline. Otherwise, immunosuppressive therapy or awaiting\nspontaneous resolution may be sufficient. If bradycardia does not\nresolve within a clinically reasonable period or cannot be expected\nto resolve (e.g. after radiation therapy), permanent pacing is indi-\ncated. Before choosing a device type, the indication for an ICD and/\nor CRT rather than a single-chamber or DDD pacemaker should be\nRecommendation for patients with LMNA gene muta-\ntions (for references, see Supplementary Table 18)\nRecommendation\nClassa\nLevelb\nIn patients with LMNA gene mutations, including\nEmery\u0002Dreifuss and limb-girdle muscular dys-\ntrophies who fulﬁl conventional criteria for pace-\nmaker implantation or who have prolonged PR\ninterval with LBBB, ICD implantation with pacing\ncapabilities should be considered if at least 1-\nyear survival is expected.616\nIIa\nC\nICD = implantable cardioverter-deﬁbrillator; LBBB, left bundle branch block.\naClass of recommendation.\nbLevel of evidence.\nRecommendations for pacing in Kearns\u0002Sayre\nsyndrome\nRecommendations\nClassa\nLevelb\nIn patients with Kearns\u0002Sayre syndrome who\nhave PR prolongation, any degree of AVB, BBB,\nor fascicular block, permanent pacing should be\nconsidered.c 621\u0002625\nIIa\nC\nIn patients with Kearns\u0002Sayre syndrome with-\nout cardiac conduction disorder, permanent\npacing may be considered\nprophylactically.c 621\u0002625\nIIb\nC\nAVB = atrioventricular block; BBB = bundle branch block; CRT = cardiac\nresynchronization therapy; ICD = implantable cardioverter-deﬁbrillator; PR = PR\ninterval.\naClass of recommendation.\nbLevel of evidence.\ncWhenever pacing is indicated, CRT or an ICD should be considered according\nto the relevant guidelines.\nESC 2021\nESC 2021\n..................................................................................................................................................................\nESC Guidelines\n51\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/35/3427/6358547 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n...........................................................................................................................................................................\nconsidered because most causes of inflammatory disease causing bra-\ndycardia may also result in reduced myocardial contractility and ven-\ntricular fibrosis.\n8.6.6.1 Sarcoidosis\nPersistent or intermittent AVB can occur in sarcoidosis, which shows\na propensity to involve the basal intraventricular septum. In a Finnish\nregistry, 143 of 325 patients (44%) diagnosed with cardiac sarcoidosis\nhad Mobitz II second- or third-degree AVB in the absence of other\nexplanatory cardiac disease.626 A history of syncope, pre-syncope, or\npalpitations points towards bradycardia, but also to potential ventric-\nular tachyarrhythmia. AVB is the most common clinical presentation\nin patients with clinically evident cardiac sarcoidosis.627,628 Diagnostic\nsteps include ECG monitoring, echocardiography, cardiac MRI, and\nmyocardial or other involved tissue biopsy. Fluorodeoxyglucose-\npositron emission tomography may be useful.629 The chances and\ntime course of resolution of AVB with immunosuppressive therapy\nare not clear,630 but may be low.88 Long-term data are available\nmainly from a Canadian prospective study (32 patients),627 a Japanese\nretrospective study (22 patients),628 and a Finnish registry (325\npatients).626 Reversibility of conduction disorder is unpredictable\nand, even in patients with transient AVB, permanent pacing should be\nconsidered.631 Immunosuppressive treatment may increase risk of\ndevice infection. However, there are no firm data to support device\nimplantation before initiation of immunosuppressive medication.\nPatients with cardiac sarcoidosis and AVB are at high risk of SCD dur-\ning long-term follow-up, even if LVEF is >35%.626 Patients with even a\nmild or moderate decrease in LVEF (35\u000249%) are at increased risk\nof SCD.632,633 Therefore, in patients with cardiac sarcoidosis who\nhave an indication for cardiac pacing and LVEF <50%, a CRT-D\nshould be considered rather than a pacemaker634 (section 6).\n8.7 Cardiac pacing in pregnancy\nVaginal delivery carries no extra risks in a mother with congenital\ncomplete heart block, unless contraindicated for obstetric rea-\nsons.635 For women who have a stable, narrow complex junctional\nescape rhythm, pacemaker implantation may not be necessary or can\nbe deferred until after delivery if none of the risk factors (syncope,\npauses >3\u0004 the cycle length of the ventricular escape rhythm, wide\nQRS escape rhythm, prolonged QT interval, complex ventricular\nectopy, mean daytime heart rate <50 b.p.m.) is present. However,\nwomen with complete heart block who exhibit a slow, wide QRS\ncomplex escape rhythm should undergo pacemaker implantation\nduring pregnancy. The risks of pacemaker implantation are generally\nlow and can be performed safely, especially if the foetus is beyond 8\nweeks gestation. A pacemaker for the alleviation of symptomatic bra-\ndycardia can be implanted at any stage of pregnancy using echo guid-\nance or electroanatomic navigation minimizing fluoroscopy.636,637\n9 Special considerations on device\nimplantations and peri-operative\nmanagement\n9.1 General considerations\nPatients with clinical signs of active infection and/or fever should not\nundergo a permanent pacemaker (including leadless pacemaker)\nimplantation until they have been afebrile for at least 24 h. Febrile\npatients who have been started on antibiotics should ideally receive a\ncomplete course of antibiotic treatment and should be afebrile for\n24 h after termination of antibiotic treatment before definite pace-\nmaker implantation is performed if acute pacing is not required. If\npossible, the use of temporary transvenous pacing should be avoided.\nIn patients in need of acute pacing, temporary transvenous pacing\nshould be established, preferably with jugular or axillar/lateral subcla-\nvian vein access.638 In a multicentre, prospective study with 6319\npatients, fever within 24 h of implantation (OR 5.83, 95% CI\n2.00\u000216.98) and temporary pacing before implantation (OR 2.46,\n95% CI 1.09\u00025.13) were positively correlated with the occurrence\nof device infection.639 In the case of patients with chronic recurrent\ninfection, minimally invasive implantation of an epicardial pacemaker\nmay be considered.\n9.2 Antibiotic prophylaxis\nThe use of pre-operative systemic antibiotic prophylaxis is re-\ncommended as the standard of care in pacemaker implantation\nprocedures. The risk of infection is significantly reduced with a single\ndose of prophylactic antibiotic (cefazolin 1\u00022 g i.v. or flucloxacillin\n1\u00022 g i.v.) given within 30\u000260 min [90\u0002120 min for vancomycin\n(15 mg/kg)] before the procedure.640\u0002643 The antibiotic prophylaxis\nshould cover S. aureus species, but routine coverage of methicillin-\nresistant S. aureus is not recommended. The use of vancomycin\nshould be guided by patient risk for methicillin-resistant S. aureus col-\nonization and the prevalence of the bacterium in the corresponding\ninstitution.638\nIn contrast, post-operative antibiotic prophylaxis does not reduce\nthe incidence of infection.644,645\n9.3 Operative environment and skin\nantisepsis\nThe pacemaker implantation procedure should be performed in an\noperating environment that meets the standards of sterility as\nrequired for other surgical implant procedures.638,646\nRecommendations for pacing in cardiac sarcoidosis\nRecommendations\nClassa\nLevelb\nIn patients with cardiac sarcoidosis who have\npermanent or transient AVB, implantation of a\ndevice capable of cardiac pacing should be con-\nsidered.c 88,629,630\nIIa\nC\nIn patients with sarcoidosis and an indication for\npermanent pacing who have LVEF <50%, implan-\ntation of a CRT-D should be considered.631,634\nIIa\nC\nAVB = atrioventricular block; CRT-D = deﬁbrillator with cardiac resynchroniza-\ntion therapy; ICD = implantable cardioverter-deﬁbrillator; LVEF = left ventricular\nejection fraction.\naClass of recommendation.\nbLevel of evidence.\ncWhenever pacing is indicated in sarcoidosis, an ICD should be considered\naccording to the relevant guidelines.\nESC 2021\n52\nESC Guidelines\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/35/3427/6358547 by guest on 14 January 2026",

However, there are no firm data to support device\nimplantation before initiation of immunosuppressive medication.\nPatients with cardiac sarcoidosis and AVB are at high risk of SCD dur-\ning long-term follow-up, even if LVEF is >35%.626 Patients with even a\nmild or moderate decrease in LVEF (35\u000249%) are at increased risk\nof SCD.632,633 Therefore, in patients with cardiac sarcoidosis who\nhave an indication for cardiac pacing and LVEF <50%, a CRT-D\nshould be considered rather than a pacemaker634 (section 6).\n8.7 Cardiac pacing in pregnancy\nVaginal delivery carries no extra risks in a mother with congenital\ncomplete heart block, unless contraindicated for obstetric rea-\nsons.635 For women who have a stable, narrow complex junctional\nescape rhythm, pacemaker implantation may not be necessary or can\nbe deferred until after delivery if none of the risk factors (syncope,\npauses >3\u0004 the cycle length of the ventricular escape rhythm, wide\nQRS escape rhythm, prolonged QT interval, complex ventricular\nectopy, mean daytime heart rate <50 b.p.m.) is present. However,\nwomen with complete heart block who exhibit a slow, wide QRS\ncomplex escape rhythm should undergo pacemaker implantation\nduring pregnancy. The risks of pacemaker implantation are generally\nlow and can be performed safely, especially if the foetus is beyond 8\nweeks gestation. A pacemaker for the alleviation of symptomatic bra-\ndycardia can be implanted at any stage of pregnancy using echo guid-\nance or electroanatomic navigation minimizing fluoroscopy.636,637\n9 Special considerations on device\nimplantations and peri-operative\nmanagement\n9.1 General considerations\nPatients with clinical signs of active infection and/or fever should not\nundergo a permanent pacemaker (including leadless pacemaker)\nimplantation until they have been afebrile for at least 24 h. Febrile\npatients who have been started on antibiotics should ideally receive a\ncomplete course of antibiotic treatment and should be afebrile for\n24 h after termination of antibiotic treatment before definite pace-\nmaker implantation is performed if acute pacing is not required. If\npossible, the use of temporary transvenous pacing should be avoided.\nIn patients in need of acute pacing, temporary transvenous pacing\nshould be established, preferably with jugular or axillar/lateral subcla-\nvian vein access.638 In a multicentre, prospective study with 6319\npatients, fever within 24 h of implantation (OR 5.83, 95% CI\n2.00\u000216.98) and temporary pacing before implantation (OR 2.46,\n95% CI 1.09\u00025.13) were positively correlated with the occurrence\nof device infection.639 In the case of patients with chronic recurrent\ninfection, minimally invasive implantation of an epicardial pacemaker\nmay be considered.\n9.2 Antibiotic prophylaxis\nThe use of pre-operative systemic antibiotic prophylaxis is re-\ncommended as the standard of care in pacemaker implantation\nprocedures. The risk of infection is significantly reduced with a single\ndose of prophylactic antibiotic (cefazolin 1\u00022 g i.v. or flucloxacillin\n1\u00022 g i.v.) given within 30\u000260 min [90\u0002120 min for vancomycin\n(15 mg/kg)] before the procedure.640\u0002643 The antibiotic prophylaxis\nshould cover S. aureus species, but routine coverage of methicillin-\nresistant S. aureus is not recommended. The use of vancomycin\nshould be guided by patient risk for methicillin-resistant S. aureus col-\nonization and the prevalence of the bacterium in the corresponding\ninstitution.638\nIn contrast, post-operative antibiotic prophylaxis does not reduce\nthe incidence of infection.644,645\n9.3 Operative environment and skin\nantisepsis\nThe pacemaker implantation procedure should be performed in an\noperating environment that meets the standards of sterility as\nrequired for other surgical implant procedures.638,646\nRecommendations for pacing in cardiac sarcoidosis\nRecommendations\nClassa\nLevelb\nIn patients with cardiac sarcoidosis who have\npermanent or transient AVB, implantation of a\ndevice capable of cardiac pacing should be con-\nsidered.c 88,629,630\nIIa\nC\nIn patients with sarcoidosis and an indication for\npermanent pacing who have LVEF <50%, implan-\ntation of a CRT-D should be considered.631,634\nIIa\nC\nAVB = atrioventricular block; CRT-D = deﬁbrillator with cardiac resynchroniza-\ntion therapy; ICD = implantable cardioverter-deﬁbrillator; LVEF = left ventricular\nejection fraction.\naClass of recommendation.\nbLevel of evidence.\ncWhenever pacing is indicated in sarcoidosis, an ICD should be considered\naccording to the relevant guidelines.\nESC 2021\n52\nESC Guidelines\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/35/3427/6358547 by guest on 14 January 2026",

If\npossible, the use of temporary transvenous pacing should be avoided.\nIn patients in need of acute pacing, temporary transvenous pacing\nshould be established, preferably with jugular or axillar/lateral subcla-\nvian vein access.638 In a multicentre, prospective study with 6319\npatients, fever within 24 h of implantation (OR 5.83, 95% CI\n2.00\u000216.98) and temporary pacing before implantation (OR 2.46,\n95% CI 1.09\u00025.13) were positively correlated with the occurrence\nof device infection.639 In the case of patients with chronic recurrent\ninfection, minimally invasive implantation of an epicardial pacemaker\nmay be considered.\n9.2 Antibiotic prophylaxis\nThe use of pre-operative systemic antibiotic prophylaxis is re-\ncommended as the standard of care in pacemaker implantation\nprocedures. The risk of infection is significantly reduced with a single\ndose of prophylactic antibiotic (cefazolin 1\u00022 g i.v. or flucloxacillin\n1\u00022 g i.v.) given within 30\u000260 min [90\u0002120 min for vancomycin\n(15 mg/kg)] before the procedure.640\u0002643 The antibiotic prophylaxis\nshould cover S. aureus species, but routine coverage of methicillin-\nresistant S. aureus is not recommended. The use of vancomycin\nshould be guided by patient risk for methicillin-resistant S. aureus col-\nonization and the prevalence of the bacterium in the corresponding\ninstitution.638\nIn contrast, post-operative antibiotic prophylaxis does not reduce\nthe incidence of infection.644,645\n9.3 Operative environment and skin\nantisepsis\nThe pacemaker implantation procedure should be performed in an\noperating environment that meets the standards of sterility as\nrequired for other surgical implant procedures.638,646\nRecommendations for pacing in cardiac sarcoidosis\nRecommendations\nClassa\nLevelb\nIn patients with cardiac sarcoidosis who have\npermanent or transient AVB, implantation of a\ndevice capable of cardiac pacing should be con-\nsidered.c 88,629,630\nIIa\nC\nIn patients with sarcoidosis and an indication for\npermanent pacing who have LVEF <50%, implan-\ntation of a CRT-D should be considered.631,634\nIIa\nC\nAVB = atrioventricular block; CRT-D = deﬁbrillator with cardiac resynchroniza-\ntion therapy; ICD = implantable cardioverter-deﬁbrillator; LVEF = left ventricular\nejection fraction.\naClass of recommendation.\nbLevel of evidence.\ncWhenever pacing is indicated in sarcoidosis, an ICD should be considered\naccording to the relevant guidelines.\nESC 2021\n52\nESC Guidelines\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/35/3427/6358547 by guest on 14 January 2026",

In a Finnish\nregistry, 143 of 325 patients (44%) diagnosed with cardiac sarcoidosis\nhad Mobitz II second- or third-degree AVB in the absence of other\nexplanatory cardiac disease.626 A history of syncope, pre-syncope, or\npalpitations points towards bradycardia, but also to potential ventric-\nular tachyarrhythmia. AVB is the most common clinical presentation\nin patients with clinically evident cardiac sarcoidosis.627,628 Diagnostic\nsteps include ECG monitoring, echocardiography, cardiac MRI, and\nmyocardial or other involved tissue biopsy. Fluorodeoxyglucose-\npositron emission tomography may be useful.629 The chances and\ntime course of resolution of AVB with immunosuppressive therapy\nare not clear,630 but may be low.88 Long-term data are available\nmainly from a Canadian prospective study (32 patients),627 a Japanese\nretrospective study (22 patients),628 and a Finnish registry (325\npatients).626 Reversibility of conduction disorder is unpredictable\nand, even in patients with transient AVB, permanent pacing should be\nconsidered.631 Immunosuppressive treatment may increase risk of\ndevice infection. However, there are no firm data to support device\nimplantation before initiation of immunosuppressive medication.\nPatients with cardiac sarcoidosis and AVB are at high risk of SCD dur-\ning long-term follow-up, even if LVEF is >35%.626 Patients with even a\nmild or moderate decrease in LVEF (35\u000249%) are at increased risk\nof SCD.632,633 Therefore, in patients with cardiac sarcoidosis who\nhave an indication for cardiac pacing and LVEF <50%, a CRT-D\nshould be considered rather than a pacemaker634 (section 6).\n8.7 Cardiac pacing in pregnancy\nVaginal delivery carries no extra risks in a mother with congenital\ncomplete heart block, unless contraindicated for obstetric rea-\nsons.635 For women who have a stable, narrow complex junctional\nescape rhythm, pacemaker implantation may not be necessary or can\nbe deferred until after delivery if none of the risk factors (syncope,\npauses >3\u0004 the cycle length of the ventricular escape rhythm, wide\nQRS escape rhythm, prolonged QT interval, complex ventricular\nectopy, mean daytime heart rate <50 b.p.m.) is present. However,\nwomen with complete heart block who exhibit a slow, wide QRS\ncomplex escape rhythm should undergo pacemaker implantation\nduring pregnancy. The risks of pacemaker implantation are generally\nlow and can be performed safely, especially if the foetus is beyond 8\nweeks gestation. A pacemaker for the alleviation of symptomatic bra-\ndycardia can be implanted at any stage of pregnancy using echo guid-\nance or electroanatomic navigation minimizing fluoroscopy.636,637\n9 Special considerations on device\nimplantations and peri-operative\nmanagement\n9.1 General considerations\nPatients with clinical signs of active infection and/or fever should not\nundergo a permanent pacemaker (including leadless pacemaker)\nimplantation until they have been afebrile for at least 24 h. Febrile\npatients who have been started on antibiotics should ideally receive a\ncomplete course of antibiotic treatment and should be afebrile for\n24 h after termination of antibiotic treatment before definite pace-\nmaker implantation is performed if acute pacing is not required. If\npossible, the use of temporary transvenous pacing should be avoided.\nIn patients in need of acute pacing, temporary transvenous pacing\nshould be established, preferably with jugular or axillar/lateral subcla-\nvian vein access.638 In a multicentre, prospective study with 6319\npatients, fever within 24 h of implantation (OR 5.83, 95% CI\n2.00\u000216.98) and temporary pacing before implantation (OR 2.46,\n95% CI 1.09\u00025.13) were positively correlated with the occurrence\nof device infection.639 In the case of patients with chronic recurrent\ninfection, minimally invasive implantation of an epicardial pacemaker\nmay be considered.\n9.2 Antibiotic prophylaxis\nThe use of pre-operative systemic antibiotic prophylaxis is re-\ncommended as the standard of care in pacemaker implantation\nprocedures. The risk of infection is significantly reduced with a single\ndose of prophylactic antibiotic (cefazolin 1\u00022 g i.v. or flucloxacillin\n1\u00022 g i.v.) given within 30\u000260 min [90\u0002120 min for vancomycin\n(15 mg/kg)] before the procedure.640\u0002643 The antibiotic prophylaxis\nshould cover S. aureus species, but routine coverage of methicillin-\nresistant S. aureus is not recommended. The use of vancomycin\nshould be guided by patient risk for methicillin-resistant S. aureus col-\nonization and the prevalence of the bacterium in the corresponding\ninstitution.638\nIn contrast, post-operative antibiotic prophylaxis does not reduce\nthe incidence of infection.644,645\n9.3 Operative environment and skin\nantisepsis\nThe pacemaker implantation procedure should be performed in an\noperating environment that meets the standards of sterility as\nrequired for other surgical implant procedures.638,646\nRecommendations for pacing in cardiac sarcoidosis\nRecommendations\nClassa\nLevelb\nIn patients with cardiac sarcoidosis who have\npermanent or transient AVB, implantation of a\ndevice capable of cardiac pacing should be con-\nsidered.c 88,629,630\nIIa\nC\nIn patients with sarcoidosis and an indication for\npermanent pacing who have LVEF <50%, implan-\ntation of a CRT-D should be considered.631,634\nIIa\nC\nAVB = atrioventricular block; CRT-D = deﬁbrillator with cardiac resynchroniza-\ntion therapy; ICD = implantable cardioverter-deﬁbrillator; LVEF = left ventricular\nejection fraction.\naClass of recommendation.\nbLevel of evidence.\ncWhenever pacing is indicated in sarcoidosis, an ICD should be considered\naccording to the relevant guidelines.\nESC 2021\n52\nESC Guidelines\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/35/3427/6358547 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n...........................................................................................\nBased on data from surgical and intravascular catheter procedures,\nskin antisepsis should be performed using chlorhexidine\u0002alcohol\ninstead of povidone-iodine\u0002alcohol.647,648 In a large RCT comprising\n2546 patients, chlorhexidine\u0002alcohol was associated with a lower\nincidence of short-term intravascular catheter-related infections (HR\n0.15, 95% CI 0.05 - 0.41; P = 0.0002).647\n9.4 Management of anticoagulation\nIt is well known that the development of a pocket haematoma after\nthe implantation of a pacemaker system significantly increases the\nrisk for subsequent pocket infection.641,643,649 The Bridge or\nContinue Coumadin for Device Surgery Randomized Controlled\nTrial (BRUISE CONTROL) proved that a clinically significant pocket\nhaematoma is an independent risk factor for subsequent device infec-\ntion (HR 7.7, 95% CI 2.9\u000220.5; P < 0.0001).649 Therefore, it is of\nutmost importance to take all steps to avoid post-operative pocket\nhaematoma.\nHeparin bridging for pacemaker implantation in patients anticoagu-\nlated with a vitamin K antagonist leads to a significant 4.6-fold increase\nin post-operative pocket haematoma compared with a continued\nwarfarin strategy.650 International normalized ratio tapering and tem-\nporary shifting of dual antiplatelet to single antiplatelet administration\nmay significantly reduce the haematoma and infection rate by 75%\nand 74%, respectively, compared with heparin bridging.651\nRegarding non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants, the\nRandomized Controlled Trial of Continued Versus Interrupted\nDirect Oral Anti-Coagulant at the Time of Device Surgery (BRUISE\nCONTROL-2) was stopped prematurely due to futility because the\nevent rate was far lower than anticipated; however, it suggested that,\ndepending on the clinical scenario and concomitant antiplatelet ther-\napy, either stopping or continuing non-vitamin K antagonist oral anti-\ncoagulants might be reasonable at the time of device implantation.652\nPatients on dual antiplatelet therapy have a significantly increased\nrisk of post-operative pocket haematoma compared with patients\ntreated with aspirin alone or without antiplatelet therapy. In such\ncases, P2Y12 receptor inhibitors should be discontinued for 3\u00027\ndays (according to the specific drug) before the procedure where\npossible and based on an individualized risk assessment.638,653,654 For\nmore details on the management of anticoagulation in the pacemaker\nprocedure, refer to Table 11.\n9.5 Venous access\nTransvenous lead implantation for pacemaker implantation is com-\nmonly performed by venous access via the cephalic, subclavian, or\naxillary vein.

In a retrospective study comprising 409\npatients and mean follow-up of 73.6 ± 33.1 months, lead failure\noccurred in 1.2% of patients with contrast-guided axillary vein punc-\nture, 2.3% of patients with cephalic vein cutdown, and 5.6% of\npatients with subclavian vein puncture. In multivariable regression\nanalysis, the only predictor of lead failure was subclavian vein punc-\nture instead of axillary vein access (HR 0.26, 95% CI 0.071\u00020.954; P\n= 0.042). When analysing the success rates of the different venous\naccess approaches, the cephalic vein approach showed the lowest\nsuccess rate (78.2% vs. axillary vein 97.6% and subclavian vein 96.8%;\nP < 0.001).661\n9.6 Lead considerations\nIn choosing between active or passive fixation pacemaker leads in the\nRA or RV, one should consider the potential for perforation and peri-\ncarditis, as well as extractability. Active fixation leads have a higher\ntendency to create pericardial effusions as well as overt perforations.\nPassive fixation leads, due to the non-isodiametric design of the lead\ntip, may be a factor in lower procedural success rates and higher risk\nfor complications with lead extraction, although this point is far from\nbeing clear and is still under evaluation.662 An RCT is required to clar-\nify this issue.\nRegarding perforations, an uncontrolled, non-randomized study\ncomprising 3815 patients with implant of an RV lead showed no sig-\nnificant difference with regards to myocardial perforations between\nactive and passive fixation leads (0.5% vs. 0.3%; P = 0.3).663 Active fix-\nation leads also allow selective site pacing in regions of the RV that\nare smooth walled (e.g. the mid-septum). The RA is, however, thin\nwalled, and perforation of the RA free wall by active fixation leads has\nbeen demonstrated. Some implanting physicians prefer to implant\npassive leads in patients at elevated risk of perforation (e.g. elderly\npatients). However, based on expert opinion and on the results of a\nsingle-centre, retrospective study on ICD leads (637 patients), in\nyoung patients, the use of active fixation leads in the RA and RV is\nrecommended in terms of future extractability.664\nLead stability and phrenic nerve stimulation are important aspects\nof coronary sinus lead implantation. With regards to both, quadripo-\nlar leads seem to have relevant advantages. The rate of phrenic nerve\nstimulation requiring lead revision is significantly lower compared\nwith that in bipolar coronary sinus leads.665,666 Furthermore, lead\nstability is increased because quadripolar leads can usually be\nimplanted in the wedged position. If implanted in an apical position\ndue to wedging, the use of the proximal poles avoids apical stimula-\ntion. Therefore, quadripolar leads are recommended for coronary\nsinus lead implantation. Active fixation LV leads via a side helix have\nbeen developed, and results have proved reliable stability, easy access\nto the target pacing site, and stable LV pacing threshold in the long\nterm. In comparison with passive fixation quadripolar leads, active fix-\nation bipolar and quadripolar leads achieved similar results. The lead\ndesign with an active fixation mechanism via a side helix was\ndeveloped to allow for full extractability in the long term. However,\nthe ease of extractability at long term has not yet been\nproven.667\u0002669\n9.7 Lead position\nVentricular pacing has traditionally been performed from the RV\napex. Since the introduction of active fixation leads, alternative pacing\nsites such as the RVOT septum or the mid-septum have been eval-\nuated in order to provide more physiological pacing. However,\ndespite two decades of research, the clinical benefit of RV non-apical\npacing remains uncertain.670 This may be partly explained by variabil-\nity in the position of the lead, which is often unintentionally placed on\nthe anterior free wall, where it may be associated with adverse out-\ncome.671\u0002673 The main advantage of septal pacing probably lies in\nthe avoidance of perforation of the free wall. In a study of 2200\npatients implanted with a pacemaker or ICD lead, an apical position\nwas independently associated with cardiac perforation (OR 3.37; P =\n0.024).420 A septal position may therefore be preferable in patients at\nincreased risk of perforation, such as elderly patients especially with a\nbody mass index <20 kg/m2, as well as women.670,674\nPlacing the lead on the mid-septum may be challenging (even more\nso in the RVOT septum, which is a smaller target area). The use of\nmultiple fluoroscopic views and specially shaped stylets is useful for\nthis purpose and is outlined in a recent EHRA consensus paper.34 In\nthis context, it is important to mention that the accuracy and repro-\nducibility of fluoroscopic assessment of RV lead positions is often\ninaccurate.421\nMultiple fluoroscopic views are also recommended for placing\nRVA leads, to ensure there is no inadvertent placement of the lead in\na coronary sinus tributary or in the LV via an intracardiac shunt or\narterial access.\nThe coronary sinus may be used for LV pacing without the need to\ncross the tricuspid valve. It may also be used in the case of other diffi-\nculties in deploying an RV lead (e.g. in the case of a tricuspid valve\nprosthesis). In selected patients, the outcome is similar to RV\npacing.675,676\nThe RA appendage is usually the preferred site for atrial pacing.\nThe lateral atrium may carry a risk of phrenic nerve capture.677,678\nAlternative pacing sites to avoid AF such as Bachman’s bundle and\nthe region of the coronary sinus ostium have not shown benefit and\nare not to be recommended in routine practice.679,680\n9.8 Device pocket\nIn recent years, there has been increasing awareness of the device\npocket as a source of complications.

The role of pocket hae-\nmatomas in the development of infections has been discussed earlier.\nIt is evident that besides adequate management of anticoagulation, a\nproper surgical technique with meticulous haemostasis is of utmost\nimportance.\nMost pacemakers are implanted with the creation of a subcutane-\nous pocket.681 In patients with a low body mass index and therefore\nlittle subcutaneous tissue, in the case of Twiddler’s syndrome, or for\naesthetic reasons, creation of a submuscular pocket may be prefera-\nble. However, this may require deeper sedation for implantation and\ngenerator replacements due to pain. To date, there are no data from\nRCTs comparing the two approaches for creating device pockets.\n54\nESC Guidelines\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/35/3427/6358547 by guest on 14 January 2026",

In a Danish\npopulation-based cohort study, complications were observed in\n9.9% of patients at first device implantation and in 14.8% upon\nupgrade or lead revision.354 Procedures limited to replacement of\nthe generator had a lower complication risk (5.9%). In the prospec-\ntive REPLACE registry, a similar proportion (4%) of complication\nrisks in the setting of generator replacement was reported, but much\nhigher risks were found in those with one or more additional lead\ninsertions (up to 15.3%).695 Accordingly, major complications were\nparticularly more common with CRT upgrade procedures, a finding\nthat was corroborated in a large US inpatient cohort339 and a pro-\nspective Italian observational study.696 The rate of procedural com-\nplications also increases with comorbidity burden.697\nThus, careful shared decision-making is warranted when consider-\ning upgrades to more complex systems. This also applies to prophy-\nlactic replacement of recalled CIED generators and leads, a scenario\nin which procedural risks should be carefully weighed against the risks\nassociated with device or lead failure.698\nOverall, complication rates are closely linked to individual and\ncentre implantation volumes.429,658,693 Complications were increased\nby 60% in inexperienced operators who had performed fewer than\nRecommendations regarding device implantations and\nperi-operative management\nRecommendations\nClassa\nLevelb\nAdministration of pre-operative antibiotic pro-\nphylaxis within 1 h of skin incision is recom-\nmended to reduce risk of CIED\ninfection.641,643.686\nI\nA\nChlorhexidine\u0002alcohol instead of povidone-\niodine\u0002alcohol should be considered for skin\nantisepsis.647,648\nIIa\nB\nFor venous access, the cephalic or axillary vein\nshould be considered as ﬁrst choice.658,659\nIIa\nB\nTo conﬁrm target ventricular lead position, use\nof multiple ﬂuoroscopic views should be\nconsidered.\nIIa\nC\nFor implantation of coronary sinus leads, quadri-\npolar leads should be considered as ﬁrst\nchoice.665,666,687\nIIa\nC\nRinsing the device pocket with normal saline sol-\nution before wound closure should be\nconsidered.683,684\nIIa\nC\nIn patients undergoing a reintervention CIED\nprocedure, the use of an antibiotic-eluting enve-\nlope may be considered.685,688\nIIb\nB\nPacing of the mid-ventricular septum may be\nconsidered in patients at high risk of perforation\n(e.g. elderly, previous perforation, low body\nmass index, women).420,674\nIIb\nC\nContinued\nIn pacemaker implantations in patients with pos-\nsible pocket issues such as increased risk of ero-\nsion due to low body mass index, Twiddler’s\nsyndrome, or for aesthetic reasons, a submuscu-\nlar device pocket may be considered.\nIIb\nC\nHeparin bridging of anticoagulated patients is\nnot recommended.650,689\nIII\nA\nPermanent pacemaker implantation is not rec-\nommended in patients with fever.

      "content": ".......................................................................................................................\nHistorical data from 1000 patients with ICD implants showed signifi-\ncantly shorter procedural times for patients with subcutaneous\ndevice pockets. No significant differences with regard to pocket hae-\nmatomas were found. There were no significant differences in the\ncumulative percentages of patients free from complication during fol-\nlow-up.682\nPocket irrigation at the end of the procedure with normal saline\nleads to dilution of possible contaminants and eliminates debris from\nthe wound before closure.683,684 Addition of antibiotics to the rinsing\nsolution does not reduce the risk of device infections.683\nThe World-wide Randomized Antibiotic Envelope Infection\nPrevention Trial (WRAP-IT study) investigated the effect of an\nabsorbable antibiotic-eluting envelope on the development of post-\noperative CIED infections. A total of 6983 patients undergoing a\nCIED pocket revision, generator replacement, or system upgrade, or\ninitial implantation of a CRT-D were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio,\nto receive the antibiotic envelope or not. The rate of CIED infection\nin patients who had the antibacterial envelope was 0.7% vs. 1.2% in\nthe control group (HR 0.6, 95% CI 0.36\u00020.98; P = 0.04).685 No effect\non infection rate was observed in the subgroup with pacemakers.685\nConsidering cost-effectiveness aspects, the use of an antibiotic enve-\nlope may be considered in pacemaker patients at high risk for CIED\ninfections. Risk factors to be considered in this context are end-stage\nrenal disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes melli-\ntus, and device replacement, revision, or upgrade procedures.638\n10 Complications of cardiac\npacing and cardiac\nresynchronization therapy\n10.1 General complications\nCardiac pacing and CRT are associated with a substantial risk of com-\nplications (Table 12), most of which occur in the perioperative\nphase,429,690 but a sizable risk remains during long-term follow-up.691\nComplication rates after dual-chamber pacemaker implantation in\nthe MOST trial were 4.8% at 30 days, 5.5% at 90 days, and 7.5% at 3\nyears.692 However, ‘real-life’ data indicate a higher risk.690,693 In a\nrecent study of >81 000 patients receiving de novo CIED implanta-\ntions, major complications occurred in 8.2% within 90 days of hospi-\ntal discharge.694 Mortality in hospital (0.5%) and within 30 days (0.8%)\nwas low.\nComplication risks generally increase with the complexity of the\ndevice and are more common in the context of a device upgrade or\nlead revisions compared with de novo implantation. In a Danish\npopulation-based cohort study, complications were observed in\n9.9% of patients at first device implantation and in 14.8% upon\nupgrade or lead revision.354 Procedures limited to replacement of\nthe generator had a lower complication risk (5.9%).

In a Danish cohort, lead-related interventions (2.4%) were\nthe most common major complication.354 LV leads have a particular\npropensity for complications such as dislodgement and coronary vein\ndissection or perforation.700 In a nationwide registry, LV leads (4.3%)\nwere more commonly associated with complications compared with\nRA leads (2.3%) and RV leads (2.2%).429 A CRT device (OR 3.3) and\npassive fixation RA lead (OR 2.2) were the most important risk\npredictors.\nA meta-analysis of 25 CRT trials noted mechanical complications\nin 3.2% (including coronary sinus dissection or perforation, pericar-\ndial effusion or tamponade, pneumothorax, and haemothorax), other\nlead problems in 6.2%, and infections in 1.4%. Peri-implantation\ndeaths occurred in 0.3%.369\n10.2.2\nHaematoma\nPocket haematoma is a frequent complication (2.1\u00029.5%), which can\nusually be managed conservatively. Evacuation, required in 0.3\u00022%\nof cases, is associated with an \u000315 times increased risk of infection.639\nMoreover, patients developing pocket haematoma stay in hospital\nlonger and have a higher in-hospital mortality rate (2.0% vs. 0.7%).724\nHence, appropriate precautions are critical, and reoperation should\nbe limited to patients with severe pain, persistent bleeding, distension\nof the suture line, and imminent skin necrosis. Many haematomas can\nbe avoided by careful haemostasis and optimal management of anti-\nplatelet and anticoagulant drugs.\n10.2.3\nInfection\nInfection is one of the most worrying CIED complications, causing\nsignificant morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs.725,726 Infection\nrates are higher with device replacement or upgrade procedures,695\nas well as CRT or ICD implants compared with simple pacemaker\nimplantation.727 Olsen et al.702 reported the lifetime risk of system\ninfection in patients with: a pacemaker (1.19%), ICD (1.91%), CRT-P\n(2.18%), and CRT-D (3.35%). Specifically, patients undergoing reop-\nerations, those with a previous device-related infection, men, and\nyounger patients had a significantly higher risk of infection.\nSimilar findings have been reported in a large cohort of patients\nreceiving an ICD, with infection rates of 1.4% for single, 1.5% for dual,\nand 2.0% for biventricular ICDs.728 In addition, early reintervention\n(OR 2.70), previous valvular surgery (OR 1.53), reimplantation (OR\n1.35), renal failure on dialysis (OR 1.34), chronic lung disease (OR\n1.22), cerebrovascular disease (OR 1.17), and warfarin use (OR 1.16)\nwere associated with an increased risk of infection.702 Infections also\noccur more frequently with use of temporary pacing or other proce-\ndures before implantation (OR 2.5 and 5.8, respectively), early rein-\nterventions (OR 15), and lack of antibiotic prophylaxis (OR\n2.5).639,729\nFurther comprehensive information on how to prevent, diagnose,\nand treat CIED infections has been provided in a recent EHRA con-\nsensus document.642\n10.2.4\nTricuspid valve interference\nCIED leads may interfere with tricuspid valve function intra-\noperatively by causing damage to the tricuspid valve leaflets or the\nsubvalvular apparatus, or chronically after operation or lead extrac-\ntion. This damage has been linked to haemodynamic deterioration\nand an adverse clinical outcome.730 In fact, moderate to severe tricus-\npid regurgitation is generally associated with excess mortality731,732\nand occurs at a significantly higher rate in CIED patients.733 The prev-\nalence of significant tricuspid regurgitation (defined as grade 2 or\nabove) following CIED implantation varies between 10% and 39%.\nMost studies attribute a greater harm with ICD leads and in the\nTable 12\nComplications of pacemaker and cardiac\nresynchronization therapy implantation\nIncidence of complications after CIED therapy\n%\nLead-related reintervention354,639,690,692,695,700,701\n(including dislodgement, malposition, subclavian crush\nsyndrome, etc.)\n1.0\u00025.9\nCIED-related infections, <12\nmonths354,639,641,645,685,695,702\n0.7\u00021.7\nSuperﬁcial infection354\n1.2\nPocket infections354\n0.4\nSystemic infections354\n0.5\nCIED-related infections, >12 months702\u0002709\n1.1\u00024.6\nPocket infections702\n1.3\nSystemic infections702,705\n0.5\u00021.2\nPneumothorax354,658,690,692,700,701,707\n0.5\u00022.2\nHaemothorax695\n0.1\nBrachial plexus injury695\n<0.1\nCardiac perforation354,663,690,692,695\n0.3\u00020.7\nCoronary sinus dissection/perforation710,288\n0.7\u00022.1\nRevision due to pain/discomfort354,690\n0.1\u00020.4\nDiaphragmatic stimulation requiring\nreintervention711,712,665,713\n0.5\u00025\nHaematoma354,639,650,652,654,690,700,714,715\n2.1\u00025.3\nTricuspid regurgitation716\u0002718\n5\u000215\nPacemaker syndrome146,701,719\n1\u000220\nGenerator/lead problem354,639,690\n0.1\u00021.5\nDeep venous thrombosis (acute or\nchronic)354,720,721\n0.1\u00022.6\nAny complication354,639,690,692,695,707,722,723\n5\u000215\nMortality (<30 days)354,694\n0.8\u00021.4\nCIED = cardiovascular implantable electronic device.\nESC 2021\n56\nESC Guidelines\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/35/3427/6358547 by guest on 14 January 2026",

Specifically, patients undergoing reop-\nerations, those with a previous device-related infection, men, and\nyounger patients had a significantly higher risk of infection.\nSimilar findings have been reported in a large cohort of patients\nreceiving an ICD, with infection rates of 1.4% for single, 1.5% for dual,\nand 2.0% for biventricular ICDs.728 In addition, early reintervention\n(OR 2.70), previous valvular surgery (OR 1.53), reimplantation (OR\n1.35), renal failure on dialysis (OR 1.34), chronic lung disease (OR\n1.22), cerebrovascular disease (OR 1.17), and warfarin use (OR 1.16)\nwere associated with an increased risk of infection.702 Infections also\noccur more frequently with use of temporary pacing or other proce-\ndures before implantation (OR 2.5 and 5.8, respectively), early rein-\nterventions (OR 15), and lack of antibiotic prophylaxis (OR\n2.5).639,729\nFurther comprehensive information on how to prevent, diagnose,\nand treat CIED infections has been provided in a recent EHRA con-\nsensus document.642\n10.2.4\nTricuspid valve interference\nCIED leads may interfere with tricuspid valve function intra-\noperatively by causing damage to the tricuspid valve leaflets or the\nsubvalvular apparatus, or chronically after operation or lead extrac-\ntion. This damage has been linked to haemodynamic deterioration\nand an adverse clinical outcome.730 In fact, moderate to severe tricus-\npid regurgitation is generally associated with excess mortality731,732\nand occurs at a significantly higher rate in CIED patients.733 The prev-\nalence of significant tricuspid regurgitation (defined as grade 2 or\nabove) following CIED implantation varies between 10% and 39%.\nMost studies attribute a greater harm with ICD leads and in the\nTable 12\nComplications of pacemaker and cardiac\nresynchronization therapy implantation\nIncidence of complications after CIED therapy\n%\nLead-related reintervention354,639,690,692,695,700,701\n(including dislodgement, malposition, subclavian crush\nsyndrome, etc.)\n1.0\u00025.9\nCIED-related infections, <12\nmonths354,639,641,645,685,695,702\n0.7\u00021.7\nSuperﬁcial infection354\n1.2\nPocket infections354\n0.4\nSystemic infections354\n0.5\nCIED-related infections, >12 months702\u0002709\n1.1\u00024.6\nPocket infections702\n1.3\nSystemic infections702,705\n0.5\u00021.2\nPneumothorax354,658,690,692,700,701,707\n0.5\u00022.2\nHaemothorax695\n0.1\nBrachial plexus injury695\n<0.1\nCardiac perforation354,663,690,692,695\n0.3\u00020.7\nCoronary sinus dissection/perforation710,288\n0.7\u00022.1\nRevision due to pain/discomfort354,690\n0.1\u00020.4\nDiaphragmatic stimulation requiring\nreintervention711,712,665,713\n0.5\u00025\nHaematoma354,639,650,652,654,690,700,714,715\n2.1\u00025.3\nTricuspid regurgitation716\u0002718\n5\u000215\nPacemaker syndrome146,701,719\n1\u000220\nGenerator/lead problem354,639,690\n0.1\u00021.5\nDeep venous thrombosis (acute or\nchronic)354,720,721\n0.1\u00022.6\nAny complication354,639,690,692,695,707,722,723\n5\u000215\nMortality (<30 days)354,694\n0.8\u00021.4\nCIED = cardiovascular implantable electronic device.\nESC 2021\n56\nESC Guidelines\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/35/3427/6358547 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n.............................................................................................................................................................................\npresence of multiple RV leads.45,46,49,445,642,685,697,709,728,730\u0002732 The\nissue of lead interference with bioprosthetic tricuspid valves or after\nannuloplasty or repair is debated. Furthermore, there is no firm evi-\ndence supporting that pacing-induced RV dyssynchrony significantly\ncontributes to tricuspid regurgitation. A recent study randomizing 63\npatients to pacing lead positions in the RV apex, RVS, or LV pacing via\nthe coronary sinus did not affect the development of tricuspid regur-\ngitation.734 The diagnostic work-up of CIED lead-related tricuspid\nregurgitation based on clinical, haemodynamic, and in particular echo-\ncardiographic (2D, 3D, and Doppler) evaluation is often challeng-\ning.735 While clear guidance for the management of tricuspid\nregurgitation in the presence of CIED leads is still lacking, a high level\nof clinical suspicion is required, not discounting the possibility that\nworsening HF may be a consequence of the mechanical effect on tri-\ncuspid leaflet mobility or coaptation.730 General treatment options\ninclude medical therapy aiming to relieve congestion and lead extrac-\ntion with careful replacement, or use of alternative pacing strategies,\nsuch as LV pacing via the coronary sinus or epicardial leads.\nHowever, transvenous lead extraction itself carries a risk of damage\nto the tricuspid valve and, hence, worsening tricuspid regurgitation.\nWhile leadless pacing eliminates the need for transvalvular leads, it\nmay still negatively affect tricuspid valve function, potentially due to\nmechanical interference and abnormal electrical and mechanical ven-\ntricular activation.736 Indications for surgical valve repair or replace-\nment in the context of CIED-induced tricuspid regurgitation follow\ncurrent recommendations based on the presence of symptoms,\nseverity of tricuspid regurgitation, and RV function. When consider-\ning tricuspid valve surgery, management of the RV lead should follow\nthe recommendations outlined in section 8.2.3.737 Methods for percu-\ntaneous tricuspid repair have recently gained major attention, but evi-\ndence in favour of such interventions in the context of lead-related\ntricuspid regurgitation is still limited.738\n10.2.5\nOther\nIncreased complication risks have been observed in women (mainly\npneumothorax and cardiac perforation) and in those with a low body\nmass index.354,739 Patients older than 80 years were also found to\nhave a lower risk of lead-related reinterventions compared with\npatients aged 60\u000279 years (1.0% vs. 3.1%).354\nFinally, suboptimal atrioventricular synchrony may lead to the\npacemaker syndrome, giving rise to cannon waves caused by simulta-\nneous atrial and ventricular contractions and symptoms of fatigue,\ndizziness, and hypotension (see section 5). Long-term RV pacing indu-\nces a dyssynchronous ventricular activation pattern that may pro-\nmote progressive LV dysfunction and clinical HF. Strategies to avoid\nand resolve the adverse effect of RV pacing have been discussed\nabove (section 6).\n11 Management considerations\nIntegrated management of pacemaker and CRT patients, delivered by\nan interdisciplinary team in partnership with the patient and family,\nshould be adopted in order to deliver comprehensive treatment\nacross the continuum of healthcare (see section 12). The integrated-\ncare approach is indicated in pacemaker and CRT patients to ensure\na patient-centred approach and patient involvement in shared\ndecision-making. The integrated-care approach has its origins in the\nchronic care model developed by Wagner et al.,740 and has the\npotential to improve clinical and patient outcomes in arrhythmia\nmanagement741\u0002743 (see section 12). Relevant specialists to be\nincluded in the interdisciplinary team are included according to the\npatient’s needs and local service availability (Figure 13).\n11.1 Magnetic resonance imaging in\npatients with implanted cardiac devices\nMRI is a frequent requirement in patients with implanted pacemakers.\nIt may cause adverse effects such as inappropriate device function\ndue to device reset or sensing problems, interaction with the mag-\nnetic reed switch, induction of currents resulting in myocardial cap-\nture, heating at the lead tip with changes in sensing or capture\nthresholds, or lead perforation. Risk factors for adverse events with\nMRIs are listed in Supplementary Table 19.\nCurrently, most manufacturers propose devices that are MRI con-\nditional. It is the entire CIED system (i.e. combination of generator\nand leads, which need to be from the same manufacturer) that deter-\nmines MRI conditionality, and not the individual elements. MRI scans\nmay be limited to 1.5 T and a whole-body specific absorption rate\n(SAR) <2 W/kg (head SAR <3.2 W/kg), but some models allow 3 T\nand up to 4 W/kg whole-body SAR. The manufacturer may specify an\nexemption period (usually 6 weeks) after implantation, but it may be\nreasonable to perform an MRI scan earlier if clinically warranted.\nThere is ample evidence that MRIs can be performed safely in non-\nconditional pacemakers, as long as a number of precautions are tak-\nen.744\u0002746 In 2017, the Heart Rhythm Society published an expert\nconsensus statement on MRIs in patients with CIEDs, which was\ndeveloped with and endorsed by a number of associations including\nthe EHRA and several radiological associations.745 For detailed rec-\nommendations on appropriate workflow and programming, see\nSupplementary Tables 20, 21, and 22 and Supplementary Figure 2.\nWhen leads are connected to a generator, the latter component\nabsorbs part of the energy and dissipates heat via the large surface\narea.

Half of the cohort had\nmeasurement of troponin levels before and after the scan, without\nany significant changes. Therefore, 1.5 T MRI scans (limited to SAR\n<1.5 W/kg) may be considered in selected patients, taking into\naccount the risk\u0002benefit ratio, particularly if the scans are extra-\nthoracic and patients are not pacemaker dependent.\nEpicardial leads connected to a generator result in a 10\u0005C increase\nin temperature during in vitro testing, and by as much as 77\u0005C with\nabandoned epicardial leads.747 Data from 23 patients with epicardial\nleads have been reported,749\u0002752 including 14 patients with aban-\ndoned epicardial leads,749\u0002751 without any adverse effect of MRI\nscans.

Furthermore, there is no firm evi-\ndence supporting that pacing-induced RV dyssynchrony significantly\ncontributes to tricuspid regurgitation. A recent study randomizing 63\npatients to pacing lead positions in the RV apex, RVS, or LV pacing via\nthe coronary sinus did not affect the development of tricuspid regur-\ngitation.734 The diagnostic work-up of CIED lead-related tricuspid\nregurgitation based on clinical, haemodynamic, and in particular echo-\ncardiographic (2D, 3D, and Doppler) evaluation is often challeng-\ning.735 While clear guidance for the management of tricuspid\nregurgitation in the presence of CIED leads is still lacking, a high level\nof clinical suspicion is required, not discounting the possibility that\nworsening HF may be a consequence of the mechanical effect on tri-\ncuspid leaflet mobility or coaptation.730 General treatment options\ninclude medical therapy aiming to relieve congestion and lead extrac-\ntion with careful replacement, or use of alternative pacing strategies,\nsuch as LV pacing via the coronary sinus or epicardial leads.\nHowever, transvenous lead extraction itself carries a risk of damage\nto the tricuspid valve and, hence, worsening tricuspid regurgitation.\nWhile leadless pacing eliminates the need for transvalvular leads, it\nmay still negatively affect tricuspid valve function, potentially due to\nmechanical interference and abnormal electrical and mechanical ven-\ntricular activation.736 Indications for surgical valve repair or replace-\nment in the context of CIED-induced tricuspid regurgitation follow\ncurrent recommendations based on the presence of symptoms,\nseverity of tricuspid regurgitation, and RV function. When consider-\ning tricuspid valve surgery, management of the RV lead should follow\nthe recommendations outlined in section 8.2.3.737 Methods for percu-\ntaneous tricuspid repair have recently gained major attention, but evi-\ndence in favour of such interventions in the context of lead-related\ntricuspid regurgitation is still limited.738\n10.2.5\nOther\nIncreased complication risks have been observed in women (mainly\npneumothorax and cardiac perforation) and in those with a low body\nmass index.354,739 Patients older than 80 years were also found to\nhave a lower risk of lead-related reinterventions compared with\npatients aged 60\u000279 years (1.0% vs. 3.1%).354\nFinally, suboptimal atrioventricular synchrony may lead to the\npacemaker syndrome, giving rise to cannon waves caused by simulta-\nneous atrial and ventricular contractions and symptoms of fatigue,\ndizziness, and hypotension (see section 5). Long-term RV pacing indu-\nces a dyssynchronous ventricular activation pattern that may pro-\nmote progressive LV dysfunction and clinical HF. Strategies to avoid\nand resolve the adverse effect of RV pacing have been discussed\nabove (section 6).\n11 Management considerations\nIntegrated management of pacemaker and CRT patients, delivered by\nan interdisciplinary team in partnership with the patient and family,\nshould be adopted in order to deliver comprehensive treatment\nacross the continuum of healthcare (see section 12). The integrated-\ncare approach is indicated in pacemaker and CRT patients to ensure\na patient-centred approach and patient involvement in shared\ndecision-making. The integrated-care approach has its origins in the\nchronic care model developed by Wagner et al.,740 and has the\npotential to improve clinical and patient outcomes in arrhythmia\nmanagement741\u0002743 (see section 12). Relevant specialists to be\nincluded in the interdisciplinary team are included according to the\npatient’s needs and local service availability (Figure 13).\n11.1 Magnetic resonance imaging in\npatients with implanted cardiac devices\nMRI is a frequent requirement in patients with implanted pacemakers.\nIt may cause adverse effects such as inappropriate device function\ndue to device reset or sensing problems, interaction with the mag-\nnetic reed switch, induction of currents resulting in myocardial cap-\nture, heating at the lead tip with changes in sensing or capture\nthresholds, or lead perforation. Risk factors for adverse events with\nMRIs are listed in Supplementary Table 19.\nCurrently, most manufacturers propose devices that are MRI con-\nditional. It is the entire CIED system (i.e. combination of generator\nand leads, which need to be from the same manufacturer) that deter-\nmines MRI conditionality, and not the individual elements. MRI scans\nmay be limited to 1.5 T and a whole-body specific absorption rate\n(SAR) <2 W/kg (head SAR <3.2 W/kg), but some models allow 3 T\nand up to 4 W/kg whole-body SAR. The manufacturer may specify an\nexemption period (usually 6 weeks) after implantation, but it may be\nreasonable to perform an MRI scan earlier if clinically warranted.\nThere is ample evidence that MRIs can be performed safely in non-\nconditional pacemakers, as long as a number of precautions are tak-\nen.744\u0002746 In 2017, the Heart Rhythm Society published an expert\nconsensus statement on MRIs in patients with CIEDs, which was\ndeveloped with and endorsed by a number of associations including\nthe EHRA and several radiological associations.745 For detailed rec-\nommendations on appropriate workflow and programming, see\nSupplementary Tables 20, 21, and 22 and Supplementary Figure 2.\nWhen leads are connected to a generator, the latter component\nabsorbs part of the energy and dissipates heat via the large surface\narea.

The use of temporary\npacing should be limited to the emergency treatment of patients with\nsevere bradyarrhythmia causing syncope and/or haemodynamic com-\npromise, and to cases in whom those bradyarrhythmias are antici-\npated. Temporary transvenous pacing is recommended when pacing\nindications are reversible, such as in the context of antiarrhythmic\ndrug use, myocardial ischaemia, myocarditis, electrolyte disturbances,\ntoxic exposure, after cardiac surgery, or as a bridge to permanent\npacemaker implantation when this procedure is not immediately\navailable or possible due to concomitant infection. Lastly, if a patient\nmeets the permanent pacemaker implantation criteria, this proce-\ndure should be performed promptly.\n11.4 Peri-operative management in\npatients with cardiovascular implantable\nelectronic devices\nAdvisory documents to help manage patients with CIEDs in the peri-\noperative period have been issued by several professional societ-\nies.786\u0002789\nSupplementary\nTable\n24\nsummarizes\ngeneral\nrecommendations on the management of these patients.\n• Electromagnetic interference (EMI) may induce oversensing\n(more likely with unipolar leads), activation of rate-responsive\nsensors, device resetting, or other damage. The most common\nsource of EMI is electrocautery, although it is rare during bipolar\nelectrocautery >5 cm from the CIED and monopolar electro-\ncautery below the umbilicus.790 To reduce the risk of EMI,\nmonopolar electrocautery should be applied in short (<5 s)\npulses, with the skin patches away from the area of the device.\nOther sources of EMI include radiofrequency procedures, nerve\nstimulators, and other electronic devices.\n• The peri-operative strategy should be tailored based on the indi-\nvidual\nneeds\nand\nvalues\nof\npatients,\nprocedure,\nand\ndevice.786\u0002789 Most procedures will not require any interven-\ntion.791 In pacemaker-dependent patients, a magnet should be\napplied during delivery of diathermy pulses, or, if EMI is likely to\noccur or magnet stability cannot be guaranteed, the device\nshould be reprogrammed to an asynchronous mode (VOO/\nDOO). The response to magnet application may differ between\ndevice manufactures. CIEDs with a rate-responsive function\nusing an active sensor may also require magnet application or\ndisabling of this function to prevent inappropriate rapid pacing.\nPost-operative CIED interrogation is recommended if malfunc-\ntion is suspected or if the device has been exposed to strong\nEMI.\n11.5 Cardiovascular implantable\nelectronic devices and sports activity\nRegular exercise is strongly recommended for prevention of cardio-\nvascular disease.792\u0002795 Restrictions to patients with a pacemaker,\nwhere appropriate, are motivated by underlying cardiovascular dis-\nease. Therefore, it is important to address issues of exercise and\nsports participation with all pacemaker patients as part of a shared\ndecision-making process. Comprehensive recommendations for\nphysical activity in patients with cardiovascular disease have been\npublished.792,796\nThere is consensus that contact sports (e.g. rugby or martial arts)\nshould be avoided so as not to risk damage of device components or\nhaematoma at the implantation site. For participation in sports such\nas football, basketball, or baseball, special protective shields are rec-\nommended to reduce the risk of trauma to the device. Sport inter-\nests and right or left arm dominance should be considered when\nselecting the implantation site, and submuscular placement can be\nconsidered to reduce the risk of impact.

It is recommended to\nabstain from vigorous exercise and ipsilateral arm exercise for 4\u00026\nweeks post-device implantation.\nOf note, recommendations regarding sports activity in patients\nwith an ICD differ from those in pacemaker patients.797,798\n11.6 When pacing is no longer indicated\nDifferent management options are available in patients with\nimplanted pacemaker systems in whom pacing is no longer indicated:\nLeave pacemaker generator and pacemaker leads in situ.\nExplant pacemaker generator and abandon leads.\nExplant pacemaker generator and leads.\nThe feasibility of option 1 depends on the end-of-life behaviour of\nthe implanted generator, which is manufacturer dependent, and may\nbe erratic and lead to complications in rare cases.799 Option 1 is the\npreferred approach to selected frail and elderly patients.\nOption 2 comes with a low procedural risk but may be associated\nwith the disadvantages of lead abandonment, including future MRI.\nEspecially in young patients, the potential necessary future require-\nment for lead extraction of abandoned leads due to infection and the\nassociated elevated procedural risk due to longer duration of implan-\ntation procedure need to be taken into account.

Thus, and in parallel with the writing of\nthese guidelines, a suite of quality indicators for patients undergoing\nCIED implantation was developed. The full list of these quality indica-\ntors, as well as their specifications and development methodology,\nhas been published elsewhere,844 with a selection presented in\nTable 15.\n14 Key messages\n• In the evaluation of candidates for permanent pacemaker implan-\ntation, a thorough and detailed pre-operative evaluation is rec-\nommended. This should always include careful history taking and\nphysical examination, laboratory testing, documentation of the\ntype of bradyarrhythmia requiring treatment, and cardiac imag-\ning. In selected cases, additional tests, EPS, and/or genetic testing\nare indicated.\n• Ambulatory ECG monitoring is useful in the evaluation of\npatients with suspected bradycardia or cardiac conduction disor-\nder, to correlate rhythm disturbances with symptoms. Choice of\ntype of monitoring should be based on frequency and nature of\nsymptoms and patient preferences.\n• In\npatients\nwith\nSND\nincluding\nthose\nwith\nbradycar-\ndia\u0002tachycardia type of SND, when symptoms can clearly be\nattributed to bradyarrhythmia, cardiac pacing is indicated.\n• In patients with SR and permanent or paroxysmal third- or\nsecond-degree type 2 or high-degree AVB, cardiac pacing is indi-\ncated irrespective of symptoms.\nTable 15\nA selection of the developed quality indicators for patients undergoing cardiovascular implantable electronic\ndevice implantation\nQuality indicator\nDomain\nCentres providing CIED services should participate in at least one CIED registry\nStructural quality indicatora\nNumerator: Number of centres participating in at least one registry for CIED\nCentres providing CIED services should monitor and report the volume of procedures performed by individ-\nual operators on an annual basis\nStructural quality indicator\nNumerator: Number of centres monitoring and reporting the volume of procedures performed by individual operators\nCentres providing CIED services should have available resources (ambulatory ECG monitoring, echocardio-\ngram) to stratify patients according to their risk for ventricular arrhythmias\nStructural quality indicator\nNumerator: Number of centres with an available ambulatory ECG and echocardiogram service\nCentres providing CIED services should have a preprocedural checklist to ensure discussion with the patient\nregarding risks, beneﬁts, and alternative treatment options\nStructural quality indicator\nNumerator: Number of centres that have a checklist to ensure discussion with patient regarding risks, beneﬁts, and alternative treatment options before\nCIED implantation\nCentres providing CIED services should have established protocols to follow-up patients within 2 - 12 weeks\nfollowing implantation\nStructural quality indicator\nNumerator: Number of centres that have an established protocol to follow up patients within 2 - 12 weeks following CIED implantation\nProportion of patients considered for CIED implantation who receive prophylactic antibiotics 1 h before their\nprocedure\nPatient assessment\nNumerator: Number of patients who receive antibiotics 1 h before their CIED implantation procedure\nDenominator: Number of patients undergoing CIED implantation procedure\nAnnual rate of procedural complicationsb 30 days following CIED implantation\nOutcomes\nNumerator: Number of patients who develop one or more procedural complicationsb within 30 days of CIED implantation\nDenominator: Number of patients undergoing CIED implantation procedure\nCIED = cardiovascular implantable electronic device; ECG = electrocardiogram.\naStructural quality indicators are binary measurements (yes/no), and thus only the numerator is deﬁned.\nbCIED-related bleeding, pneumothorax, cardiac perforation, tamponade, pocket haematoma, lead displacement (all requiring intervention), or infection.\nESC 2021\nESC Guidelines\n65\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/35/3427/6358547 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\n..........................................................................................................................................................................\n• In patients with permanent AF and permanent or paroxysmal\nAVB, single-lead ventricular pacing is indicated.\n• In patients with syncope and unexplained falls, the diagnosis\nshould be ascertained using the available diagnostic methods\nbefore pacemaker treatment is considered.\n• In patients with symptomatic HF and LVEF <_35% despite OMT\nwho are in SR and have LBBB QRS morphology, CRT is recom-\nmended when QRS duration is >_150 ms, and should be consid-\nered when QRS duration is 130\u0002149 ms. For patients with non-\nLBBB QRS morphology, evidence for benefit of CRT is less con-\nvincing, especially with normal PR and QRS duration <150 ms.\nCRT should not be used in patients with HF and QRS duration\n<130 ms, unless there is need for ventricular pacing.\n• Selection of patients for CRT based on imaging is limited to the\nmeasurement of LVEF, whereas the assessment of other factors,\nsuch as extent of myocardial scar, presence of mitral regurgita-\ntion, or RV systolic function, is important to anticipate potential\nnon-responders who may need additional treatments (e.g. mitral\nvalve intervention).\n• In patients with permanent AF, symptomatic HF, LVEF <_35%,\nand QRS >_130 ms who remain in NYHA class III or ambulatory\nIV despite OMT, CRT should be considered.\n• For patients with AF and CRT, AVJ ablation should be consid-\nered when at least 90\u000295% effective biventricular pacing cannot\nbe achieved.\n• For patients with high-degree AVB and an indication for cardiac\npacing who have HFrEF (LVEF <40%), CRT rather than RV pac-\ning is recommended.\n• HBP may result in normal or near-normal ventricular activation,\nand is an attractive alternative to RV pacing. To date, no data\nfrom randomized trials support that HBP is non-inferior to RV\npacing with respect to safety and efficacy. Therefore, HBP may\nbe considered for selected patients with AVB and LVEF >40%,\nwho are anticipated to have >20% ventricular pacing.\n• In patients offered HBP, implantation of an RV lead used as\n‘backup’ for pacing should be considered individually.\n• HBP may correct ventricular conduction in a subset of patients\nwith LBBB and may therefore be used in lieu of biventricular pac-\ning for HBP-based CRT in selected patients.\n• In patients treated with HBP, device programming tailored to\nspecific requirements of HBP must be ensured.\n• Implanting a leadless pacemaker should be considered when no\nupper extremity venous access exists, when risk of device\npocket infection is particularly increased, and in patients on\nhaemodialysis.\n• Patients undergoing TAVI are at increased risk of developing\nAVB. Decisions regarding cardiac pacing after TAVI should be\ntaken based upon pre-existing and new conduction disturbances.\nAmbulatory ECG monitoring for 7\u000230 days or EPS may be con-\nsidered in patients post-TAVI with new LBBB or progression of\npre-existing conduction anomaly, but not yet any indication for a\npacemaker.\n• In patients undergoing surgery for endocarditis or tricuspid valve\nsurgery who have or develop AVB under surgery, placement of\nepicardial pacing leads during surgery should be considered.\n• To reduce the risk of complications, pre-operative anti-\nbiotics\nmust\nbe\nadministered\nbefore\nCIED\nprocedures,\nchlorhexidine\u0002alcohol should be preferred for skin antisepsis,\nand cephalic or axillary vein access should be attempted as first\nchoice.\n• Heparin bridging should be avoided in CIED procedures to mini-\nmize the risk of haematoma and pocket infection.\n• In patients undergoing a CIED reintervention procedure, using\nan antibiotic-eluting envelope may be considered to reduce the\nrisk of infection.\n• In the majority of patients with a pacemaker or CRT, a well-\nindicated MRI can be performed if no epicardial leads, aban-\ndoned or damaged leads, or lead adaptors/extenders are\npresent, and certain precautions are taken.\n• Radiation therapy can be offered to patients with a pacemaker\nor CRT if an individualized treatment planning and risk stratifica-\ntion is done beforehand and the device is interrogated as recom-\nmended around the period of radiation therapy.\n• Remote device management is valuable for earlier detection of\nclinical problems and technical issues, and may allow longer spac-\ning between in-office follow-ups.\n• The principles of patient-centred care and shared decision-\nmaking should be used in the consultation both pre-operatively\nand during follow-up for patients considered for or living with a\npacemaker or CRT.\n15 Gaps in evidence\nClinicians responsible for managing pacemaker and CRT candidates,\nand patients, must frequently make treatment decisions without\nadequate evidence or consensus of expert opinion. The following is a\nshort list of selected, common issues that deserve to be addressed in\nfuture clinical research.\n• Best pre-implant evaluation programme, including when to apply\nadvanced imaging methods to ensure optimal choice of CIED for\neach patient.\n• Benefit of implementing genetic testing of CIED patients and\ntheir relatives when conduction tissue disease is diagnosed.\n• Whether use of rate-adaptive pacing in general is beneficial in\npatients with SND.\n• Whether catheter ablation of AF without pacemaker implanta-\ntion is non-inferior to pacemaker implantation with respect to\nfreedom from bradycardia-related symptoms in patients with\nsymptomatic conversion pauses after AF.\n• In patients with reflex syncope, studies of which pacing mode is\nsuperior are needed.\n• In patients with an indication for VVI pacing, the long-term effi-\ncacy and safety of choosing leadless pacing need to be docu-\nmented in RCTs.\n• In patients with HF, it remains to be shown that CRT improves\noutcome in patients without LBBB.\n• In patients with permanent/persistent AF, HF, and BBB, any ben-\neficial effects of CRT remain to be proven in RCTs.\n• There is a lack of RCTs documenting the effect of CRT in\npatients with HF treated with novel HF drugs including sacubitril/\nvalsartan, ivabradine, and sodium\u0002glucose co-transporter-2\ninhibitors.\n66\nESC Guidelines\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/35/3427/6358547 by guest on 14 January 2026",

In addition, the selection of CRT candidates who are\nmost likely to benefit from HBP is not yet defined.\n• Further studies are needed to determine whether HBP could be\nused to improve response in CRT non-responders.\n• The efficacy and safety of left bundle branch area pacing remain\nto be documented.\n• Superiority of a specific location for the RV lead (i.e. septal, out-\nflow tract, or apical) has not been documented for standard pac-\ning indicated for bradycardia or for CRT.\n• Better prediction of who will develop AVB after TAVI is needed.\n• In symptomatic patients with end-stage HCM and LBBB, there is\na need to better define the criteria for CRT implantation and\ndocument the clinical features associated with sustained benefit\nfrom the procedure.\n• Optimal treatment including cardiac pacing for patients with\ncongenital AVB should be investigated.\n• In pacemaker candidates with cardiomyopathies with >1 year\nexpected survival who do not fulfil standard criteria for ICD\nimplantation, criteria for ICD instead of pacemaker implantation\nshould be better defined.\n• The optimal pre-operative handling in CIED implantations and\npotential use of pre-operative skin disinfection and/or pre-\nhospitalization decolonization in S. aureus carriers remains to be\ndetermined.\n• The optimal approach for the different operational procedure\nelements in CIED implantations, especially for choice of venous\naccess, active or passive fixation leads in right-sided chambers,\nspecific pacing sites, use of haemostatic agents in the pocket,\nchoice of suture types, and application of pressure dressing at\nthe end of the procedure remains to be determined.\n• Patients with a need for immediate cardiac pacing occasionally\npresent with fever and infection; typically, treatment includes\ntemporary transvenous pacing and antibiotics, followed by\nimplantation of a permanent pacemaker after the infection has\nresolved. It is unknown whether immediate implantation of a\npermanent pacemaker after initiation of antibiotics would be\ninferior.\n• The role of patient education, patient-centred care, and shared\ndecision-making should be studied in CIED populations.\n16 ‘What to do’ and ‘what not to do’ messages from the Guidelines\n............ ............\nRecommendations\nClassa\nLevelb\nEvaluation of the patient with suspected or documented bradycardia or conduction system disease\nMonitoring\nAmbulatory ECG monitoring is recommended in the evaluation of patients with suspected bradycardia to correlate rhythm\ndisturbances with symptoms.\nI\nC\nCarotid massage\nOnce carotid stenosis is ruled out,c CSM is recommended in patients with syncope of unknown origin compatible with a\nreﬂex mechanism or with symptoms related to pressure/manipulation of the carotid sinus area.\nI\nB\nExercise test\nExercise testing is recommended in patients who experience symptoms suspicious of bradycardia during or immediately after\nexertion.\nI\nC\nImaging\nCardiac imaging is recommended in patients with suspected or documented symptomatic bradycardia to evaluate the pres-\nence of structural heart disease, to determine LV systolic function, and to diagnose potential causes of conduction\ndisturbances.\nI\nC\nLaboratory tests\nIn addition to pre-implant laboratory tests,d speciﬁc laboratory tests are recommended in patients with clinical suspicion for\npotential causes of bradycardia (e.g. thyroid function tests, Lyme titre, digitalis level, potassium, calcium, and pH) to diagnose\nand treat these conditions.\nI\nC\nContinued\nESC Guidelines\n67\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/35/3427/6358547 by guest on 14 January 2026\n\n\nSleep evaluation\nScreening for SAS is recommended in patients with symptoms of SAS and in the presence of severe bradycardia or advanced\nAVB during sleep.\nI\nC\nRecommendation for implantable loop recorder\nIn patients with infrequent (less than once a month) unexplained syncope or other symptoms suspected to be caused by bra-\ndycardia in whom a comprehensive evaluation did not demonstrate a cause, long-term ambulatory monitoring with an ILR is\nrecommended.\nI\nA\nCardiac pacing for bradycardia and conduction system disease\nIn patients with SND and a DDD pacemaker, minimization of unnecessary ventricular pacing through programming is\nrecommended.\nI\nA\nPacing is indicated in SND when symptoms can clearly be attributed to bradyarrhythmias.\nI\nB\nPacing is indicated in symptomatic patients with the bradycardia\u0002tachycardia form of SND to correct bradyarrhythmias and\nenable pharmacological treatment, unless ablation of the tachyarrhythmia is preferred.\nI\nB\nPacing is not recommended in patients with bradyarrhythmias related to SND which are asymptomatic or due to transient\ncauses that can be corrected and prevented.\nIII\nC\nPacing is indicated in patients in SR with permanent or paroxysmal third- or second-degree type 2, infranodal 2:1, or high-\ndegree AVB, irrespective of symptoms.e\nI\nC\nPacing is indicated in patients with atrial arrhythmia (mainly AF) and permanent or paroxysmal third- or high-degree AVB,\nirrespective of symptoms.\nI\nC\nIn patients with permanent AF in need of a pacemaker, ventricular pacing with rate response function is recommended.\nI\nC\nPacing is not recommended in patients with AVB due to transient causes that can be corrected and prevented.\nIII\nC\nIn patients with unexplained syncope and bifascicular block, a pacemaker is indicated in the presence of either a baseline HV\ninterval of >_70 ms, second- or third-degree intra- or infra-Hisian block during incremental atrial pacing, or abnormal response\nto pharmacological challenge.\nI\nB\nPacing is indicated in patients with alternating BBB with or without symptoms.\nI\nC\nPacing is not recommended for asymptomatic BBB or bifascicular block.\nIII\nB\nRecommendations for pacing for reﬂex syncope\nDual-chamber cardiac pacing is indicated to reduce recurrent syncope in patients aged >40 years, with severe, unpredictable,\nrecurrent syncope who have:\n• spontaneous documented symptomatic asystolic pause(s) >3 s or asymptomatic pause(s) >6 s due to sinus arrest or AVB;\nor\n• cardioinhibitory carotid sinus syndrome;
