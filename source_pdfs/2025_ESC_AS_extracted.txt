SECTION 8: AORTIC STENOSIS

Severity Assessment Criteria:

MILD Aortic Stenosis:
- Aortic Valve Area (AVA): >1.5 cm²
- Indexed AVA (AVAi): >0.85 cm²/m²  
- Mean Gradient: <25 mmHg
- Peak Velocity (Vmax): <3.0 m/s

MODERATE Aortic Stenosis:
- Aortic Valve Area (AVA): 1.0-1.5 cm²
- Indexed AVA (AVAi): 0.60-0.85 cm²/m²
- Mean Gradient: 25-40 mmHg  
- Peak Velocity (Vmax): 3.0-4.0 m/s

SEVERE Aortic Stenosis:
- Aortic Valve Area (AVA): <1.0 cm²
- Indexed AVA (AVAi): <0.60 cm²/m²
- Mean Gradient: >40 mmHg
- Peak Velocity (Vmax): >4.0 m/s

VERY SEVERE Aortic Stenosis:
- Mean Gradient: ≥60 mmHg
- Peak Velocity (Vmax): >5.0 m/s

Special Situations:
- Low-Flow Low-Gradient AS: Mean gradient <40 mmHg with AVA <1.0 cm²
  * With reduced LVEF: Consider dobutamine stress echo
  * With normal LVEF: Stroke Volume Index (SVi) ≤35 mL/m²

Additional Diagnostic Tools:
- CT Calcium Scoring: Severe AS if Agatston units >2000 (women) or >3000 (men)
- Stress Testing: Exercise-induced symptoms or abnormal BP response in asymptomatic patients
- Biomarkers: BNP/NT-proBNP elevation >3x age/sex normal range

Intervention Indications - Symptomatic Severe AS:
- Intervention recommended in all eligible symptomatic patients with high-gradient severe AS
- Low-flow, low-gradient AS with reduced LVEF: intervention considered if reduced LV function is predominantly caused by excessive afterload
- Low-flow, low-gradient AS with normal LVEF: intervention considered after careful confirmation that AS is severe

Intervention Indications - Asymptomatic Severe AS:
- LV dysfunction (LVEF <55%) without another cause
- LVEF ≥50% with low procedural risk AND one of:
  * Very severe AS (mean gradient ≥60 mmHg or Vmax >5.0 m/s)
  * Severe valve calcification with Vmax progression ≥0.3 m/s/year
  * Markedly elevated BNP/NT-proBNP (>3x age/sex normal range)
- LVEF >55% with normal exercise test, low procedural risk, AND one of:
  * Very severe AS (mean gradient ≥60 mmHg or Vmax >5 m/s)
  * Severe valve calcification with Vmax progression ≥0.3 m/s/year
  * Markedly elevated BNP levels confirmed on repeated measurements

Mode of Intervention - Symptomatic Severe AS:
- Choice based on Heart Team evaluation of clinical, anatomical, and procedural factors
- TAVI recommended: ≥75 years, high risk (>8% STS-PROM/EuroSCORE II), or unsuitable for surgery
- TAVI recommended: ≥70 years with tricuspid AV and suitable anatomy
- SAVR recommended: <75 years, low risk (<4% STS-PROM/EuroSCORE II), or unsuitable for transfemoral TAVI
- SAVR recommended: <70 years with low surgical risk

Follow-up Recommendations:
- Severe AS: follow-up every 6 months for early symptom detection
- Younger patients with mild AS and no calcification: every 2-3 years
- Moderate degenerative AS: re-evaluated at least annually
- Serial natriuretic peptide measurements provide additional timing information

Key Points from 2025 Guidelines:
- Mean gradient is the most robust parameter
- Discordant findings require additional testing
- Severe valve calcification on CT supports AS severity diagnosis
- Serial Vmax progression ≥0.3 m/s/year indicates disease progression
- Heart Team approach essential for complex decisions
- Patient-centered decision making emphasized
